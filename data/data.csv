Internet erupts after learning alleged shooter 'granted asylum this year' by Trump admin,"29 year-old Afghan national Rahmanullah Lakanwal was arrested Wednesday and accused of shooting two National Guardsmen in downtown Washington D.C., who both are currently hospitalized in critical condition. The alleged gunman's motive has not yet been revealed, but President Donald Trump insinuated in a video address posted to Truth Social that the shooting could be attributed to former President Joe Biden's immigration and refugee policy.""The suspect in custody is a foreigner who entered out country from Afghanistan — a hellhole on earth. He was flown in by the Biden administration in September 2021,"" Trump said. ""... His status was extended under legislation signed by President Biden ... This attack underscores the single greatest national security threat facing our nation.""However, CNN law enforcement and intelligence analyst John Miller said Wednesday that new information about Lakanwal suggests that the Trump administration may be more to blame for Lakanwal's residency than Biden. He pointed out that the alleged shooter may have had his visa sponsored by U.S. military personnel as part of programs in place meant to help Afghanis fleeing the Taliban who helped the United States.""He applies for asylum in December of 2024,"" Miller said. ""Now, he goes through another vetting process involving that, and he's approved for asylum in April of this year, under the Trump administration.""The new revelations sparked outrage on social media. Writer Wajahat Ali tweeted: ""Why did Trump invite a man who shot the National Guard?""""Am I doing this right, MAGA? I am, right? I'm following your logic,"" he wrote. ""So, yeah, Donald Trump should be blamed entirely.""""The [alleged] shooter was granted asylum this year,"" observed Colorado State University political science professor Maria Isabel Puerta Riera.""WHY DID THE FBI LEAVE THIS OUT OF THEIR BRIEFING?"" New York Times bestselling author Don Winslow wrote on X. ""WHY DIDN'T KASH PATEL MENTION ANY OF THIS?""Researcher Arif Ammar noted that there are still ""many questions"" on the nature of the Wednesday shooting including the ""motive of the assailant,"" ""who sponsored his evacuation from Afghanistan"" and any ""possible adverse affiliation of the suspect.""",https://www.rawstory.com/alternet-posts/trump-admin-asylum-shooter/

'Perversion of justice': Legal expert slams prosecutor for handing Trump an easy court win,"A legal expert slammed prosecutors in Georgia on Wednesday after they moved to dismiss a long-standing case against President Donald Trump because it would take too long to prosecute. Prosecutors in Georgia charged Trump with crimes under the state's RICO statutes for his attempts to interfere in the 2020 presidential election. The trial dragged out as Trump's lawyers argued that the former prosecutor, Fani Willis, was providing improper benefits to another prosecutor, Nathan Wade. A judge ultimately ruled that Willis needed to be replaced on the case. The new prosecutor, Pete Skandalakis, the executive director of the Prosecuting Attorneys' Council of Georgia, moved to dismiss the case against Trump on Wednesday, arguing that it would take too long to prosecute. Legal expert Glenn Kirschner, a former federal prosecutor, discussed Skandalakis' motion to dismiss the case on his podcast, ""Justice Matters.""""The veteran prosecutor, Skandalakis, said it would be illogical, unduly burdensome, and costly to try the remaining 14 defendants in the case without Trump,"" Kirschner said. ""Given that he's the central figure named in the indictment, it would be unduly burdensome and costly to try to hold the other indicted co-conspirators accountable for their crimes.""""[At] what price? Democracy?"" Kirschner added. ""What's the value on America's free and fair elections?""Trump and 18 others were charged with harassing Georgia state officials like Secretary of State Brad Raffensberger and state election workers to overturn the result of Georgia's 2020 election. In a now-infamous call, Trump demanded that Raffensberger ""find"" more than 11,000 votes to swing the outcome of the election in his favor. ""Nobody said prosecuting was easy or fun or inexpensive,"" he continued. ""But to say a case like this, where Donald Trump is on an audio recording saying just find me 11,780 votes, is too costly, too burdensome, or would take too long, is a perversion of justice.""",https://www.rawstory.com/trump-2674347379/

Trump gets a tongue-lashing over 'sedition' antics from Karl Rove,"President Donald Trump got a tongue-lashing from the conservative Karl Rove on Wednesday, over his constant stream of social media provocations that have now escalated to death threats against members of Congress.""We’re witnessing the rise of a new class of political performance artists,"" wrote Rove. ""They want to be at the center of national attention, creating chaos and conflict, shocking sensibilities, and unleashing dark passions. The hard work of legislation, of addressing Americans’ real needs, is of little interest. Instead, they compete to see who can say the most outrageous and inflammatory things. Their goal is more posts, more views, and more reactions — positive or negative, it doesn’t matter.""This has happened in a number of spheres of the right, Rove wrote, including Nick Fuentes, the extremist ""Groyper"" founder who has praised Adolf Hitler and denied the Holocaust; and the now-resigning Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene (R-GA), who suggested on social media ""that satellites, possibly controlled by the Rothschilds, started California forest fires.""But it is Trump himself, Rove wrote, who remains the master of social media fire-starting.""Given Donald Trump’s online domination, even generally sensible Democrats and Republicans have stopped being serious and started seeking more retweets and followers. Take the six Congressional Democrats, all veterans of the military or the CIA, who released a video last week encouraging active-duty service personnel to 'refuse illegal orders' from Mr. Trump,"" wrote Rove. While it was provocative to do so without actually naming an illegal order from Trump, Rove argued, Trump took it up to 11 by calling the video ""sedition"" and ""punishable by death.""""The lack of trust Americans have in our institutions may be in part a reaction to how blaring our political discourse is and how preoccupied it is with pointless matters,"" Rove concluded. ""It’s likely to get louder and the topics more idiotic until someone shows a better way. That’s probably years off. Change will require a new wave of leaders with different values and sensibilities. But the sooner someone starts, the sooner we’ll be free of this. And voters will be grateful.""",https://www.rawstory.com/trump-wsj-2674347358/

'Risk to our survival': Trump attacks immigration in dark speech following DC shooting,"President Donald Trump described immigration as a ""risk to our survival"" in a dark speech on Wednesday night. Trump posted a video on his Truth Social page where he discussed the attack in Washington, D.C., that left two National Guard troops critically injured. Authorities believe a 29-year-old immigrant from Afghanistan named Rahmanullah Lakanwal from Bellingham, Washington, carried out the shooting. Lakanwal was injured during the shooting and treated at a local hospital. He is in custody, and reports indicated he was not cooperating with authorities.

No country can tolerate such a risk to our very survival.""Trump added that his administration is going to review the 78,000 visa applications of Afghan nationals who were let into the U.S. after Al-Qaeda toppled the country's government in 2021. The Afghan nationals who were let in received a special visa to recognize their service for the U.S. military during the War on Terror. ""We're not going to put up with these kinds of assaults on law and order by people who shouldn't even be in our country,"" Trump said. ""We must now reexamine every single alien who has entered our country from Afghanistan under Biden, and we must take all necessary measures to ensure the removal of any alien from any country who does not belong here, or add benefit to our country.

'Boss is on the hunt': Ex-insider warns Trump official faces 'political wood chipper',"A former insider in Trump world warned on Wednesday that someone in the president's orbit is ""about to get fed to the political wood chipper.""Michael Cohen, Trump's former attorney for more than a decade, wrote in a new essay for Meidas+ that FBI Director Kash Patel's days in the administration may be numbered. He cited ongoing issues with Patel's use of FBI resources, like taking a government jet to go on a date with his girlfriend, country music singer Alexis Wilkins, and providing her with an FBI security detail. ""If you’ve ever worked for Donald Trump—as I did for over a decade—you learn to recognize the early warning signs that someone’s about to get fed to the political wood chipper,"" Cohen wrote. ""It starts as a tiny vibration in the building, like the air pressure drops a little because the universe knows Trump is blaming someone else for whatever is his mess of the day. Staffers walk faster. Aides avoid eye contact. And somewhere deep in the West Wing, a printer starts printing out a fresh stack of résumés just in case."" ""That’s when you know: the Boss is on the hunt for a fall guy,"" he added. ""And right now, judging by the headlines, the whispers, and the level of panic coming out of the FBI’s corner offices, Kash Patel might as well be wearing a neon sign that says 'FUTURE FORMER EMPLOYEE.'Patel was one of Trump's fiercest allies during the 2024 campaign. He was a regular pundit on right-wing podcasts who helped sell Trump's message to young men and conservative voters nationwide. Since joining the administration, Patel has faced a wave of criticism. For instance, he has gotten rowdy with lawmakers during committee hearings and has released unconfirmed information during the FBI investigation into conservative activist Charlie Kirk's assassination. ""So will Trump actually fire Kash Patel?"" Cohen asked. ""In Trump World, it almost doesn’t matter. The threat is the point. The paranoia is the glue. The uncertainty is the currency.""Read the entire essay by clicking here.",https://www.rawstory.com/kash-patel-2674347352/

Trump blindsides key ally with stunning demand,"President Donald Trump privately told the prime minister of Japan to back off its aggressive stance against China invading Taiwan, reported the Wall Street Journal — a move that blindsided an allied leader whom Trump generally praises for hawkishness.""Days after Japanese Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi outraged China by suggesting a Chinese attack on Taiwan could mobilize a Tokyo military response, Xi spent half of an hourlong phone call with Trump, people briefed on the matter said, hammering home China’s historic claim to the democratic self-governing island as well as Washington and Beijing’s joint responsibility to manage the world order,"" said the report. Then, the same day, Trump ""set up a call with Takaichi and advised her not to provoke Beijing on the question of Taiwan’s sovereignty, said Japanese officials and an American briefed on the call.""Per the report, Trump gave Takaichi ""subtle"" advice and did not tell her to actually retract her previous statements, acknowledging the political constraints she faced — but did urge her to tone down the rhetoric.In response to the story, Trump issued a statement to the Journal.“The United States relationship with China is very good, and that’s also very good for Japan, who is our dear and close ally. Getting along with China is a great thing for China and the U.S. In my opinion, President Xi will be substantially upping his purchase of soybean and other farm products, and anything good for our farmers is good for me,” Trump said, adding, “We signed wonderful trade deals with Japan, China, South Korea, and many other nations, and the world is at peace. Let’s keep it that way!”Trump has spent much of the year in an aggressive stance of his own against China, particularly on the issue of trade, where an economic war he instigated has resulted in devastation for U.S. farmers who depend on exporting their crops.",https://www.rawstory.com/trump-japan-2674347341/
Epstein victims named in newest release accuse Trump DOJ of 'intentionally' outing them,"Several women who were victimized by deceased child predator Jeffrey Epstein are now accusing President Donald Trump's Department of Justice (DOJ) of publicizing their identifying information on purpose.That's according to a Wednesday article in the Wall Street Journal, which reported that the DOJ failed to redact of dozens of women's names from emails it received from Epstein's estate. One spokeswoman for the House Oversight Committee — which released the emails earlier this month — said the committee's subpoena specifically instructs the DOJ to redact victims' names, though one document shows the full names of 28 victims.""Many of the victims believe this is being done intentionally,"" wrote attorneys Bradley Edwards and Brittany Henderson, who represent hundreds of Epstein's accusers.On Wednesday, U.S. District Judge Richard Berman (who former President Bill Clinton appointed to the Southern District of New York in 1998) ordered the DOJ to provide him with its privacy process, including how it makes redactions to protect victims. Berman, who presided over Epstein's 2019 criminal case until he died in prison, is tasked with approving requests to unseal documents relating to the case.""Our request is simply that the identity of all victims be protected,"" attorneys for victims wrote in a letter that Berman attached to his decision. ""These women are not political pawns. They are mothers, wives, and daughters.""Last week, Trump signed the Epstein Files Transparency Act into law, which compels the DOJ to publish all remaining documents and evidence pertaining to Epstein's two federal criminal investigations. The law requires the DOJ release the documents within a 30-day window, and gives Attorney General Pam Bondi the discretion to redact both the names of victims and anything that could jeopardize an ongoing investigation. Attorneys for the victims have reportedly provided the DOJ with a list of approximately 300 names in order to ensure all victims' personal information is redacted. FBI Director Kash Patel reportedly authorized nearly $1 million in overtime expenditures earlier this year on having roughly 1,000 agents redact the full Epstein files. Agents were reportedly told to flag all mentions of Trump in the files. The effort was known as the ""Epstein Transparency Project"" (which some referred to derisively as the ""special redaction project"").Click here to read the Journal's article in its entirety (subscription required).",https://www.rawstory.com/alternet-posts/trump-doj-epstein-victims/

'Cold-blooded': Analyst in awe as 'best way to disarm Trump' just revealed,"A rising political star on the left may have revealed the best way to disarm President Donald Trump, according to one analyst. Zohran Mamdani, the Democratic Socialist mayor-elect of New York City, recently met with Trump at the White House after enduring weeks of threats from the president that he would cut off funding to Mamdani's city if he were elected. Will Saletan, a writer at The Bulwark, argued in a new article that the ""chummy"" meeting between the two leaders also revealed Mamdani's strategy for dealing with Trump. Part of Mamdani's strategy is to show Trump that he can take away Trump's voters, Saletan noted. That was why Trump ""fawned"" over Mamdani during the meeting, even though Mamdani implicitly called him a fascist during the meeting. ""Why did Trump laugh off these words?"" Saletan asked. ""Because to him words mean nothing. The only thing he respects is power.""""That might sound cold-blooded,"" he continued. ""But if Mamdani is right about the big picture—if the best way to disarm a despot is to dismantle the conditions that brought him to power—then calling out Trump’s fascism won’t do the job. What will do the job is proving to Americans that an anti-fascist government can make their lives more affordable.""Read the entire column by clicking here.",https://www.rawstory.com/trump-2674347313/

'This is the scandal': Experts floored as 'staggering' figures undercut key Trump pledge,"The libertarian Cato Institute this week further undermined the Trump administration’s claims that it is targeting “the worst of the worst” with its violent immigration operations in communities across the United States by publishing data about the criminal histories—or lack thereof—of immigrants who have been arrested and booked into detention.David J. Bier, the institute’s director of immigration studies, previously reported in June that 65% of people taken by US Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) had no convictions, and 93% had no violent convictions.Monday evening, Bier shared a new nonpublic dataset leaked to Cato. Of the 44,882 people booked into ICE custody from when the fiscal year began on October 1 through November 15, 73% had no criminal convictions. For that share, around two-thirds also had no pending charges.The data also show that most of those recently booked into ICE detention with criminal convictions had faced immigration, traffic, or vice charges. Just 5% had a violent conviction, and 3% had a property conviction.“Other data sources support the conclusions from the number of ICE book-ins,” Bier wrote, citing information on agency arrests from January to late July—or the first six months of President Donald Trump’s second term—that the Deportation Data Project acquired via a public records request.The data show that as of January 1, just before former President Joe Biden left office, 149 immigrants without charges or convictions were arrested by ICE. That number surged by 1,500% under Trump: It peaked at 4,072 in June and ultimately was 2,386 by the end of July—when 67% of all arrestees had no criminal convictions, and 39% had neither convictions nor charges.Bier also pointed to publicly available data about current detainees on ICE’s website, emphasizing that “the number of people in detention who were convicted of a crime and had no pending charges increased a staggering 2,370% since January from fewer than 1,000 to over 21,000.”In addition to publishing an article on Cato’s site, Bier detailed the findings on the social media platform X, where various critics of the administration’s immigration crackdown weighed in. Among them was Congresswoman Yassamin Ansari (D-Ariz.), who said: “These are the facts. I’ve spoken to dozens of people held inside ICE detention centers in Arizona and this tracks.”US Sen. Chris Murphy (D-Conn.) declared: “This is the scandal. Trump isn’t targeting dangerous people. He’s targeting peaceful immigrants. Almost exclusively.”The US Department of Homeland Security, which includes ICE, also jumped in, as did DHS spokesperson Tricia McLaughlin. Responding to Murphy, McLaughlin said in part: “This is so dumb it hurts my soul. This is a made-up pie chart with no legitimate data behind it—just propaganda to undermine the brave work of DHS law enforcement and fool Americans.”Bier and others then took aim at McLaughlin, with the Cato director offering the raw data and challenging her to “just admit you don’t care whether the people you’re arresting are threats to others or not.”Here's the raw ""made up"" data from your department. What do you gain from lying about this? Just admit you don't care whether the people you're arresting are threats to others or not. https://t.co/6IAyLTOEfN https://t.co/85rocYB4AV pic.twitter.com/TfXhNzy8j4— David J. Bier (@David_J_Bier) November 26, 2025 Aaron Reichlin-Melnick, a senior fellow at the American Immigration Council, said that “DHS’s spokeswoman lies AGAIN,” calling out her post as “either a knowing lie or an egregious mistake.”“The data David J. Bier published was distributed to multiple congressional staffers and is just a more detailed breakdown of data, which is publicly available on ICE’s own website,” he stressed.Journalist Jose Olivares noted that this is “not the first time Tricia McLaughlin has said that ICE’s own data is ‘propaganda.’ Months ago, she slammed me and my colleague at the Guardian on PBS... even though we used ICE’s own data for our reporting.”",https://www.rawstory.com/donald-trump-ice/

Trump says lax migration policies are top national security threat after National Guard members shot,"President Donald Trump said Wednesday’s “heinous assault” on two National Guard members near the White House proves that lax migration policies are “the single greatest national security threat facing our nation.”“No country can tolerate such a risk to our very survival,” he said.Trump’s remarks, released in a video on social media, underscores his intention to reshape the country’s immigration system and increase scrutiny of migrants who are already here. With aggressive deportation efforts already underway, his response to the shooting showed that his focus will not waver.The suspect in the shooting is believed to be an Afghan national, according to Trump and two law enforcement officials. He entered the United States in September 2021, after the chaotic collapse of the government in Kabul, when Americans were frantically evacuating people as the Taliban took control.The 29-year-old suspect was part of Operation Allies Welcome, the Biden-era program that resettled tens of thousands of Afghans after the U.S. withdrawal from the country, officials said. The initiative brought roughly 76,000 Afghans to the United States, many of whom had worked alongside American troops and diplomats as interpreters and translators.It has since faced intense scrutiny from Trump and his allies, congressional Republicans and some government watchdogs over gaps in the vetting process and the speed of admissions, even as advocates say it offered a lifeline to people at risk of Taliban reprisals.Trump described Afghanistan as “a hellhole on earth,” and he said his administration would review everyone who entered from the country under President Joe Biden — a measure his administration had already been planning before the incident.During his remarks, Trump also swung his focus to Minnesota, where he complained about “hundreds of thousands of Somalians” who are “ripping apart that once-great state.”Minnesota has the country’s largest Somali community, roughly 87,000 people. Many came as refugees over the years. The reference to immigrants with no connection to Wednesday’s developments was a reminder of the scope of Trump’s ambitions to rein in migration.ImmigrationNov 19Migrants thought they were in court for a routine hearing. Instead, it was a deportation trapImmigrationNov 17Immigrant student enrollment drops across U.S., straining school budgets and forcing cutsImmigrationNov 16Immigration crackdown inspires uniquely Chicago pushback that's now a model for other citiesAdministration officials have been ramping up deportations of people in the country illegally, as well as clamping down on refugee admissions. The focus has involved the realignment of resources at federal agencies, stirring concern about potentially undermining other law enforcement priorities.However, Trump’s remarks were a signal that scrutiny of migrants and the nation’s borders will only increase. He said he wants to remove anyone “who does not belong here or does not add benefit to our country.”“If they can’t love our country, we don’t want them,” Trump added. Afterward, the United States Citizenship and Immigration Services announced it would indefinitely stop processing all immigration requests for Afghan nationals pending a review of security and vetting protocols.Supporters of Afghan evacuees said they feared that people who escaped danger from the Taliban would now face renewed suspicion and scrutiny. “I don’t want people to leverage this tragedy into a political ploy,” said Shawn VanDiver, president of #AfghanEvac.He said Wednesday’s shooting should not shed a negative light on the tens of thousands of Afghan nationals who have gone through the various legal pathways to resettling in the U.S. and those who await in the pipeline.Under Operation Allies Welcome, tens of thousands of Afghans were first brought to U.S. military bases around the country, where they completed immigration processing and medical evaluations before settling into the country. Four years later, there are still scores of Afghans who were evacuated at transit points in the Middle East and Europe as part of the program.Those in countries like Qatar and Albania, who have undergone the rigorous process, have been left in limbo since Trump entered his second term and paused the program as part of his series of executive actions cracking down on immigration.Vice President JD Vance, writing on social media, criticized Biden for “opening the floodgate to unvetted Afghan refugees,” adding that “they shouldn’t have been in our country.”“Already some voices in corporate media chirp that our immigration policies are too harsh,” he said. “Tonight is a reminder of why they’re wrong.”Amiri reported from New York.

Farmers bemoan crushing Trump tariffs facing higher prices during holiday season,"US farmers warned on Tuesday that they are under increasing strain thanks to President Donald Trump’s tariffs, and they predicted more price increases were coming for American consumers during the holiday season.As reported by The Packer, representatives from the Kansas Farmers Union, supermarket chain supplier Royal Food, and North Carolina-based Red Scout Farm detailed during a conference call how Trump’s tariffs on nearly all imported goods were raising prices on vegetables, fruits, grains, and meats.Mary Carol Dodd, owner of Red Scout Farm, said during the call that her farm depends on products imported from other countries, including greenhouse materials, insect netting, and produce bags. With no low-cost domestic substitutes for these products available, said Dodd, she will have no choice but to raise prices.“When the price of everything it takes to grow vegetables goes up, from soil to tools to fertilizer, packaging, transportation, then the vegetables on the holiday table go up as well,” Dodd explained. “For a small, diversified farm like us, those costs add up quickly. Our profit margins are already very thin, so every increase means tough choices.”For Dodd, those tough choices have taken the form of a 50% price hike on collard greens and kale, and a 50-cent price increase on mixed-lettuce bags.Nick Levendofsky, executive director of the Kansas Farmers Union, said during the call that price increases were inevitable given that most farms already operate on razor-thin profit margins.“Every added cost in the supply chain eventually shows up at the checkout line,” he said. “Tariffs stack up on top of already high input costs, and families end up paying more for the same ingredients they bought last year.”Colin Tuthill, president of Royal Food, expressed bewilderment that the president would enact policies that raised Americans’ food prices, especially after he won an election last year on the promise to reduce grocery prices starting on his first day in office.“Placing a tariff or a tax on any kind of food item makes absolutely no sense to me,” he said. “We’re raising the price of food for the most in need.”The American Federation of Teachers, Century Foundation, and Groundwork Collaborative last week issued a report estimating that Thanksgiving costs for US consumers have gone up by roughly 10% over the last year, with staples such as onions, spiral hams, and cranberry sauce all recording increases of 22% or higher.The groups also found that Trump’s policies were squarely to blame for the price increases, and not just the tariffs. Specifically, they pointed to chaos at agencies such as the US Department of Agriculture that have weakened efforts to contain bird flu on US farms, which has in turn hurt the supply of poultry heading into the holiday season.Although Trump has walked back some of his tariffs on staples such as coffee, bananas, and chocolate, the groups noted that this rollback likely came too late to offer relief to US families this year.“Trump campaigned on bringing down the price of groceries on day one,” they wrote. “Yet in the biggest grocery week of the year, families across the country aren’t seeing any savings. Instead, their budgets are being carved up alongside the Thanksgiving turkey.”",https://www.rawstory.com/trump-tariffs-2674346801/

"“He’s losing his touch”: Trump pitches new name for “Trump Republicans,” and some critics think he’s lost it","President Donald Trump's recent suggestions for what we should call ""Trump Republicans"" have people speculating that he's lost his touch. For all his many, many flaws, even his staunchest critics will often admit that he had a flair for coming up with nicknames.What he dreamed up for his followers this week was so bad, even one of his failsons had something better.What do you call Trump Republicans?In a recent Truth Social post, Trump appeared to ask for feedback on his ideas for a new name for a specific type of Republican. While ""Trump Republican"" has already been in use for years, he wants something a little shorter.""There is a new word for TRUMP REPUBLICAN, which is almost everyone (GREAT POLICY IS THE KEY!),"" he claimed. “It is TEPUBLICAN??? Or, TPUBLICAN???”@yashar/XBoth equally terrible choices alongside a highly dubious claim about how many people would embrace the title. It's unclear if he's soliciting a vote on these two options after declaring that there is a single new word for the group.Regardless, Donald Trump Jr. replied with something that outshone his father's ideas. He's not going to like that.@DonaldJTrumpJr/X""Shouldn’t it really be Trumplican???"" Junior asked.While it sounds like something out of Dr. Seuss, that's still better than ""Tepublican.""""Trump lost his fast ball""Trump used to be famous for his ability to come up with insulting nicknames that not only stuck with his fans but seemed pointedly accurate. ""Sleepy Joe"" hit the nail on the head during a time when speculation over the health of former President Joe Biden was hurting his poll numbers.There was something about ""Meatball Ron.""@WUTangKids/X""Trump lost his fast ball with the insults or whatever the hell this is supposed to be,"" @WUTangKids said about ""Tpublicans.""Maybe it's because a nickname for Trump Republicans isn't meant to be insulting, but Trump's ideas are bad enough that it's helping to stir up accusations that his own health is failing.""I’m sorry—you think this guy DIDN’T have a stroke?"" asked @adamscochran. ""Come on! Grandpa’s brain is pudding!""@BillKristol/X""He’s an idiot,"" avid Trump critic Bill Kristol declared. ""A dangerous idiot at the head of a dangerous movement—but nonetheless an idiot.""Other left-leaning users did find something good to say about the president's suggestions—in a manner of speaking.""Tepublican sounds about right for a party that hasn’t had a real policy idea since Obama was in office,"" said journalist Alex Cole. ""I like it!""Some even offered up their own ideas.@maddenifico/X""Trumplican? I see no reason to create a new name,"" wrote singer-songwriter Bill Madden.

'It's just sort of silly': Internal GOP fights breaking out over Trump 'being weak',"An internal fight has broken out in the GOP over whether President Donald Trump is healthy — and who could lead the Republican party after him. Stuart Stevens, The Lincoln Project senior adviser, told MS NOW host Chris Jansing Wednesday that Trump should not have to say or prove he's healthy. And that by addressing his health and mental decline rumors he has actually signaled he might be acutely aware of his age and health. ""Look, I think that on election day a couple of weeks ago, Donald Trump aged a lot, and his ability to determine the outcome of these races is pretty much over. He's a declining political asset, though,"" Stevens said.As Trump inches closer to 80, ""he's getting older and people just see this,"" Stevens added. ""You can't deny this. I mean, it's anytime you're putting out a statement saying, well, I'm really not tired. I'm really not. It's just sort of silly,"" Stevens said. Republicans are beginning to have internal struggles over who will be next in the party's succession. ""I mean, you have to just show that Republican party is still under the control of Donald Trump, but they realize that he is a fading leader, and there is great dissension underneath about what is going to be next and that's where these internal fights are. But it's all driven by Trump being weak. If he was stronger, this wouldn't be happen. If Trump had 55% approval ratings, I don't think people would be talking about the fact that he fell asleep in the oval office,"" Stevens said.",https://www.rawstory.com/it-s-just-so-silly-internal-gop-fights-breaking-out-over-trump-being-weak/

'Truly extraordinary': Analyst shocked by Trump insider's conduct in negotiation,"A stunned analyst Wednesday said that a Trump administration official coached Russia on how to win over President Donald Trump in the proposed peace plan between Russia and Ukraine. Trump envoy Steve Witkoff is facing criticism over his handling of the negotiations with Russia to end the conflict in Ukraine, which has been considered overly favorable to Russia. The unusual move was questioned by Ben Rhodes, former Deputy National Security advisor in the President Barack Obama administration, in a conversation with MS NOW's Chris Jansing on Wednesday. ""It's unthinkable that we'd have a situation like this where it feels like the Russians kind of brought their own maximalist surrender plan, essentially for Ukraine to Witkoff thinking that he would be, you know, essentially a friendly voice inside the administration. And then we subsequently learned that, as you know, Marco Rubio is over there trying to make this a little bit more balanced and still overwhelmingly favoring Russia,"" Rhodes said. Rhodes explained that the scenario would never have happened during the Obama administration. ""You've got, you know, Witkoff coaching the Russians on how to flatter trump to get him on their side before he talks to Zelenskyy. I mean, I could see a scenario in which you might coach an ally, you know, about how to enter negotiations, not how to handle your own president, but how to deal with negotiations. But it's truly extraordinary that we're kind of so far through the looking glass here, Chris, that we have a close associate of the president, United States, coaching Russia on how to get the best terms possible in a quote unquote peace deal that is essentially validating their invasion of Ukraine,"" Rhodes added.",https://www.rawstory.com/truly-extraordinary-analyst-says-trump-insider-coached-russia-on-how-to-flatter-trump/

"Trump jokes about naming pardoned turkeys “Chuck and Nancy,” calls Illinois governor a “big, fat slob”","President Donald Trump staged the White House’s annual turkey pardon on Tuesday, Nov. 25, and the ceremony weirdly doubled as a pseudo-comedic roast. He joked that he was re-pardoning last year’s birds because they, according to him, received only an ""autopen"" reprieve. What Trump said at the Thanksgiving turkey pardonHe claimed the former president’s late-term orders were ""totally invalid,"" a line he used often enough that an autopen portrait replaced Biden’s official photo in one White House hallway.https://twitter.com/Breaking911/status/1993369270647243074Trump said, ""The turkeys known as Peach and Blossom last year have been located, and they were on their way to be processed [...] but I have stopped that journey, and I am officially pardoning them."" He added that the reprieve ensured they ""will not be served as Thanksgiving dinner.""Trump added that he had briefly considered naming this year's turkeys ""Chuck and Nancy,"" a reference to Democratic leaders Chuck Schumer and Nancy Pelosi. Their actual names are Gobble and Waddle.https://twitter.com/ArynneWexler/status/1993376373763891406Their arrival gave him another reason to take a swipe at political adversaries. ""When I first saw their pictures [...] I was going to call them Chuck and Nancy, but then I realized I wouldn’t be pardoning them. I would never pardon those two people,"" Trump claimed.The president takes aim at Illinois Gov. JB PritzkerThe president also riffed about his staff drafting mock paperwork to send Gobble and Waddle ""straight through the terrorist confinement center in El Salvador, and even those birds don’t want to be there."" Trump then shifted to a tense moment when referencing Democratic Illinois Gov. JB Pritzker. The governor has been pushing back against the presence of ICE and the U.S. Customs and Border Protection in Illinois. In October, he signed an executive order to create the Illinois Accountability Commission, which will document what he called the agencies' ""unlawful attacks"" within Illinois.The president said that his team had written a joke for him about Pritzker. However, after hearing about the young woman who was set on fire on a Chicago train, he claimed he couldn't. Instead, Trump said, ""The mayor is incompetent, and the governor is a big fat slob.""As White House reporter Philip Wegmann pointed out on X, ""Trump calls Illinois Gov. Pritzker 'a fat slob,' but then he pauses and admits, 'I’d like to lose a few pounds too by the way.'""@PhilipWegmann/X@YHyperbole joked, ""Man finds his long-lost solitary crumb of self-awareness and promptly loses it again.""@YHyperbole/XThe internet is chaotic—but we’ll break it down for you in one daily email.

Crucial swing voters 'no longer fooled' by Trump — and Republicans are worried,"Although Donald Trump's victory over Democratic nominee Kamala Harris in the United States' 2024 presidential election wasn't the ""landslide"" he claims it was — Trump won the national popular vote by roughly 1.5 percent — his gains with everyone from Latinos to Generation Z to independents got him past the finish line. 2024 marked Trump's fourth presidential campaign and the first time he won the popular vote, and his victory came despite the fact that he was facing four criminal indictments at the time.The economy was a key factor in Trump's gains with independents and swing voters. But with fears about the health of the U.S. economy growing, Trump is, according to polls, losing ground with them. In a conversation for The New Republic's ""The Daily Blast"" podcast posted on November 26, host Greg Sargent (a former Washington Post columnist) and his colleague Monica Potts lay out some reasons why Trump's gains with swing voters and independents are rapidly disappearing ten months into his second presidency. And those reasons range from health care to the economy to foreign policy.Potts said of health insurance, ""We had the lowest uninsured rate in the history of the United States in 2023.... It was the point of the Affordable Care Act.... to get as many people in this country insured as possible to move us toward universal health care. And Republicans let those enhanced subsidies expire. And what's happened as a result of that is that insurers have increased their premium rates. So right now, as we speak, people who buy health care on the insurance marketplaces are looking at the costs for next year, and they're seeing premiums for the same plans go up.""Potts added, ""Some people are seeing really dramatic increases.... For other people, it’s increases of thousands of dollars for their family coverage. And some people are deciding to opt out and not buy insurance.""Trump, Potts noted, ran ""on affordability issues"" in 2024 — and now, ""affordability"" is a key source of anxiety for the independents and swing voters who favored him last year.""Energy bills are expensive,"" Potts told Sargent. ""The labor market is not very good right now. People feel stuck in their jobs. They feel like they're not making enough. They feel like they can't move forward. And so, people aren't very optimistic right now. And I think that all the things that Trump is doing are really making it worse to a huge degree.... I think that one thing to keep in mind, which is something I always try to remember, is that most people just do not pay that much attention to the ins and outs of politics or every single thing that every president does. And so, you know, in a lot of people's minds, Trump was still a successful businessman — and they had a, maybe a false memory or they had a kind of a rosy memory of the economy before COVID and they thought, well, things were better then. And he's a businessman — maybe he can get us out of this mess because (Joe) Biden had the bad luck to serve for four years that included a really weird post-COVID-era and high inflation.""Potts continued, ""And so, I think that some people just thought, 'Well, he's a businessman, he can bring us jobs, he can straighten out the economy. Without thinking too much more about it. And so, I think that there were some voters who voted for Trump for that reason, and they’re no longer fooled. They can see now what's happening.""

'MAGA's cracking': Insiders reportedly 'realizing there's life on the other side of Trump',"Donald Trump‘s fall from grace with many of his MAGA fans over growing questions about his relationship with convicted sex abuser Jeffrey Epstein appears to portend the end of his years spouting populist rhetoric that has brought various conservative factions into his tent.That is according to political observer Anand Giridharadas on MS NOW on Wednesday.Drawing upon his column in the New York Times, where he wrote about the flood of Epstein emails released to the public, Giridharadas told a “Morning Joe” panel, “MAGA is cracking.”“You are starting to see that on this story and story after story that the uneasy alliance between a traditional conservative, the kind of movement you were, you were a soldier in years ago and the modern anti-democratic, populist January 6th kind of group — that uneasy, unholy alliance is starting to come apart.” “It's starting to come apart over like, should your people have health care or not? Should you defend people from an affordability crisis or not?” he added. “It's coming apart over Epstein. It's coming apart over basic questions of whether this is a liberal democracy or not; and you are actually starting to see moments of courage and moments of people realizing that there is life for them on the far side of Donald Trump, that they may still be here when he's not.”""People actually coming back to their senses in certain cases, or in this case, Donald Trump having better instincts about, you know, maybe not caring about people is not the best way to win elections,” he added. - YouTube youtu.be",https://www.rawstory.com/trump-unholy-alliance-crumbles/

Steve Bannon urges Trump admin to court martial former NASA astronaut,"MAGA podcaster and former White House chief strategist Steve Bannon is daring Secretary of Defense Pete Hegeseth to make good on his threats and to court martial Sen. Mark Kelly (D-AZ) after Kelly appeared in a video with five other Democrats telling members of the military they have a legal right and obligation to refuse illegal orders Mediaite reports.Kelly is a former NASA astronaut and a decorated U.S. Navy combat veteran who served for 25 years, retiring with the rank of Captain. Bannon argued Wednesday on his WarRoom podcast that Hegseth's ordering a review of Kelly over his statement is not enough.“We’ve got to stop messing around! Kelly’s got to be recalled. We don’t need to wait until 10, December, Pete,” Bannon said. “It’s pretty obvious what [Kelly] did. Just recall him back to active duty and let’s convene a court martial. Let’s roll.”Hegseth demanded the Navy secretary review Kelly’s comments in a recent video featuring him and other Democratic lawmakers for “potentially unlawful conduct"" by December 10.Bannon said that deadline was ""way too long,"" adding, “Do it today. We don’t need the secretary of the Navy involved. The secretary of war should just do it.”Bannon, who served as an officer in the United States Navy for seven years, from 1976 to 1983, also said Kelly should be recalled to active duty (something that can be done for a court martial, but it is rare) Wednesday, a court martial should be convened as soon as Monday, Mediaite reports.Kelly, who fired back at President Donald Trump's Truth Social tirade in which he said the Democrats in the video should be jailed and put on trial for “seditious behavior,"" and that such behavior is “punishable by death,"" has accused the administration of trying to “intimidate” him and others by having the FBI interview all of them.“My wife, Gabby Giffords, was nearly assassinated — shot in the head at a political even,” Kelly told MS NOW. “We have rising political violence in this country, even the president — two assassination attempts.
