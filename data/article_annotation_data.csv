Farmers bemoan crushing Trump tariffs facing higher prices during holiday season,"US farmers warned on Tuesday that they are under increasing strain thanks to President Donald Trump’s tariffs, and they predicted more price increases were coming for American consumers during the holiday season.As reported by The Packer, representatives from the Kansas Farmers Union, supermarket chain supplier Royal Food, and North Carolina-based Red Scout Farm detailed during a conference call how Trump’s tariffs on nearly all imported goods were raising prices on vegetables, fruits, grains, and meats.Mary Carol Dodd, owner of Red Scout Farm, said during the call that her farm depends on products imported from other countries, including greenhouse materials, insect netting, and produce bags. With no low-cost domestic substitutes for these products available, said Dodd, she will have no choice but to raise prices.“When the price of everything it takes to grow vegetables goes up, from soil to tools to fertilizer, packaging, transportation, then the vegetables on the holiday table go up as well,” Dodd explained. “For a small, diversified farm like us, those costs add up quickly. Our profit margins are already very thin, so every increase means tough choices.”For Dodd, those tough choices have taken the form of a 50% price hike on collard greens and kale, and a 50-cent price increase on mixed-lettuce bags.Nick Levendofsky, executive director of the Kansas Farmers Union, said during the call that price increases were inevitable given that most farms already operate on razor-thin profit margins.“Every added cost in the supply chain eventually shows up at the checkout line,” he said. “Tariffs stack up on top of already high input costs, and families end up paying more for the same ingredients they bought last year.”Colin Tuthill, president of Royal Food, expressed bewilderment that the president would enact policies that raised Americans’ food prices, especially after he won an election last year on the promise to reduce grocery prices starting on his first day in office.“Placing a tariff or a tax on any kind of food item makes absolutely no sense to me,” he said. “We’re raising the price of food for the most in need.”The American Federation of Teachers, Century Foundation, and Groundwork Collaborative last week issued a report estimating that Thanksgiving costs for US consumers have gone up by roughly 10% over the last year, with staples such as onions, spiral hams, and cranberry sauce all recording increases of 22% or higher.The groups also found that Trump’s policies were squarely to blame for the price increases, and not just the tariffs. Specifically, they pointed to chaos at agencies such as the US Department of Agriculture that have weakened efforts to contain bird flu on US farms, which has in turn hurt the supply of poultry heading into the holiday season.Although Trump has walked back some of his tariffs on staples such as coffee, bananas, and chocolate, the groups noted that this rollback likely came too late to offer relief to US families this year.“Trump campaigned on bringing down the price of groceries on day one,” they wrote. “Yet in the biggest grocery week of the year, families across the country aren’t seeing any savings. Instead, their budgets are being carved up alongside the Thanksgiving turkey.”",https://www.rawstory.com/trump-tariffs-2674346801/,"Economy, Markets & Business"

It's just sort of silly': Internal GOP fights breaking out over Trump 'being weak',"An internal fight has broken out in the GOP over whether President Donald Trump is healthy — and who could lead the Republican party after him. Stuart Stevens, The Lincoln Project senior adviser, told MS NOW host Chris Jansing Wednesday that Trump should not have to say or prove he's healthy. And that by addressing his health and mental decline rumors he has actually signaled he might be acutely aware of his age and health. ""Look, I think that on election day a couple of weeks ago, Donald Trump aged a lot, and his ability to determine the outcome of these races is pretty much over. He's a declining political asset, though,"" Stevens said.As Trump inches closer to 80, ""he's getting older and people just see this,"" Stevens added. ""You can't deny this. I mean, it's anytime you're putting out a statement saying, well, I'm really not tired. I'm really not. It's just sort of silly,"" Stevens said. Republicans are beginning to have internal struggles over who will be next in the party's succession. ""I mean, you have to just show that Republican party is still under the control of Donald Trump, but they realize that he is a fading leader, and there is great dissension underneath about what is going to be next and that's where these internal fights are. But it's all driven by Trump being weak. If he was stronger, this wouldn't be happen. If Trump had 55% approval ratings, I don't think people would be talking about the fact that he fell asleep in the oval office,"" Stevens said.",https://www.rawstory.com/it-s-just-so-silly-internal-gop-fights-breaking-out-over-trump-being-weak/,Domestic U.S. Politics & Policy

Truly extraordinary': Analyst shocked by Trump insider's conduct in negotiation,"A stunned analyst Wednesday said that a Trump administration official coached Russia on how to win over President Donald Trump in the proposed peace plan between Russia and Ukraine. Trump envoy Steve Witkoff is facing criticism over his handling of the negotiations with Russia to end the conflict in Ukraine, which has been considered overly favorable to Russia. The unusual move was questioned by Ben Rhodes, former Deputy National Security advisor in the President Barack Obama administration, in a conversation with MS NOW's Chris Jansing on Wednesday. ""It's unthinkable that we'd have a situation like this where it feels like the Russians kind of brought their own maximalist surrender plan, essentially for Ukraine to Witkoff thinking that he would be, you know, essentially a friendly voice inside the administration. And then we subsequently learned that, as you know, Marco Rubio is over there trying to make this a little bit more balanced and still overwhelmingly favoring Russia,"" Rhodes said. Rhodes explained that the scenario would never have happened during the Obama administration. ""You've got, you know, Witkoff coaching the Russians on how to flatter trump to get him on their side before he talks to Zelenskyy. I mean, I could see a scenario in which you might coach an ally, you know, about how to enter negotiations, not how to handle your own president, but how to deal with negotiations. But it's truly extraordinary that we're kind of so far through the looking glass here, Chris, that we have a close associate of the president, United States, coaching Russia on how to get the best terms possible in a quote unquote peace deal that is essentially validating their invasion of Ukraine,"" Rhodes added.",https://www.rawstory.com/truly-extraordinary-analyst-says-trump-insider-coached-russia-on-how-to-flatter-trump/,International Politics & Diplomacy

"Trump jokes about naming pardoned turkeys “Chuck and Nancy,” calls Illinois governor a “big, fat slob”","President Donald Trump staged the White House’s annual turkey pardon on Tuesday, Nov. 25, and the ceremony weirdly doubled as a pseudo-comedic roast. He joked that he was re-pardoning last year’s birds because they, according to him, received only an ""autopen"" reprieve. What Trump said at the Thanksgiving turkey pardonHe claimed the former president’s late-term orders were ""totally invalid,"" a line he used often enough that an autopen portrait replaced Biden’s official photo in one White House hallway.https://twitter.com/Breaking911/status/1993369270647243074Trump said, ""The turkeys known as Peach and Blossom last year have been located, and they were on their way to be processed [...] but I have stopped that journey, and I am officially pardoning them."" He added that the reprieve ensured they ""will not be served as Thanksgiving dinner.""Trump added that he had briefly considered naming this year's turkeys ""Chuck and Nancy,"" a reference to Democratic leaders Chuck Schumer and Nancy Pelosi. Their actual names are Gobble and Waddle.https://twitter.com/ArynneWexler/status/1993376373763891406Their arrival gave him another reason to take a swipe at political adversaries. ""When I first saw their pictures [...] I was going to call them Chuck and Nancy, but then I realized I wouldn’t be pardoning them. I would never pardon those two people,"" Trump claimed.The president takes aim at Illinois Gov. JB PritzkerThe president also riffed about his staff drafting mock paperwork to send Gobble and Waddle ""straight through the terrorist confinement center in El Salvador, and even those birds don’t want to be there."" Trump then shifted to a tense moment when referencing Democratic Illinois Gov. JB Pritzker. The governor has been pushing back against the presence of ICE and the U.S. Customs and Border Protection in Illinois. In October, he signed an executive order to create the Illinois Accountability Commission, which will document what he called the agencies' ""unlawful attacks"" within Illinois.The president said that his team had written a joke for him about Pritzker. However, after hearing about the young woman who was set on fire on a Chicago train, he claimed he couldn't. Instead, Trump said, ""The mayor is incompetent, and the governor is a big fat slob.""As White House reporter Philip Wegmann pointed out on X, ""Trump calls Illinois Gov. Pritzker 'a fat slob,' but then he pauses and admits, 'I’d like to lose a few pounds too by the way.'""@PhilipWegmann/X@YHyperbole joked, ""Man finds his long-lost solitary crumb of self-awareness and promptly loses it again.""@YHyperbole/XThe internet is chaotic—but we’ll break it down for you in one daily email.

Crucial swing voters 'no longer fooled' by Trump — and Republicans are worried,"Although Donald Trump's victory over Democratic nominee Kamala Harris in the United States' 2024 presidential election wasn't the ""landslide"" he claims it was — Trump won the national popular vote by roughly 1.5 percent — his gains with everyone from Latinos to Generation Z to independents got him past the finish line. 2024 marked Trump's fourth presidential campaign and the first time he won the popular vote, and his victory came despite the fact that he was facing four criminal indictments at the time.The economy was a key factor in Trump's gains with independents and swing voters. But with fears about the health of the U.S. economy growing, Trump is, according to polls, losing ground with them. In a conversation for The New Republic's ""The Daily Blast"" podcast posted on November 26, host Greg Sargent (a former Washington Post columnist) and his colleague Monica Potts lay out some reasons why Trump's gains with swing voters and independents are rapidly disappearing ten months into his second presidency. And those reasons range from health care to the economy to foreign policy.Potts said of health insurance, ""We had the lowest uninsured rate in the history of the United States in 2023.... It was the point of the Affordable Care Act.... to get as many people in this country insured as possible to move us toward universal health care. And Republicans let those enhanced subsidies expire. And what's happened as a result of that is that insurers have increased their premium rates. So right now, as we speak, people who buy health care on the insurance marketplaces are looking at the costs for next year, and they're seeing premiums for the same plans go up.""Potts added, ""Some people are seeing really dramatic increases.... For other people, it’s increases of thousands of dollars for their family coverage. And some people are deciding to opt out and not buy insurance.""Trump, Potts noted, ran ""on affordability issues"" in 2024 — and now, ""affordability"" is a key source of anxiety for the independents and swing voters who favored him last year.""Energy bills are expensive,"" Potts told Sargent. ""The labor market is not very good right now. People feel stuck in their jobs. They feel like they're not making enough. They feel like they can't move forward. And so, people aren't very optimistic right now. And I think that all the things that Trump is doing are really making it worse to a huge degree.... I think that one thing to keep in mind, which is something I always try to remember, is that most people just do not pay that much attention to the ins and outs of politics or every single thing that every president does. And so, you know, in a lot of people's minds, Trump was still a successful businessman — and they had a, maybe a false memory or they had a kind of a rosy memory of the economy before COVID and they thought, well, things were better then. And he's a businessman — maybe he can get us out of this mess because (Joe) Biden had the bad luck to serve for four years that included a really weird post-COVID-era and high inflation.""Potts continued, ""And so, I think that some people just thought, 'Well, he's a businessman, he can bring us jobs, he can straighten out the economy. Without thinking too much more about it. And so, I think that there were some voters who voted for Trump for that reason, and they’re no longer fooled. They can see now what's happening.""

MAGA's cracking': Insiders reportedly 'realizing there's life on the other side of Trump',"Donald Trump‘s fall from grace with many of his MAGA fans over growing questions about his relationship with convicted sex abuser Jeffrey Epstein appears to portend the end of his years spouting populist rhetoric that has brought various conservative factions into his tent.That is according to political observer Anand Giridharadas on MS NOW on Wednesday.Drawing upon his column in the New York Times, where he wrote about the flood of Epstein emails released to the public, Giridharadas told a “Morning Joe” panel, “MAGA is cracking.”“You are starting to see that on this story and story after story that the uneasy alliance between a traditional conservative, the kind of movement you were, you were a soldier in years ago and the modern anti-democratic, populist January 6th kind of group — that uneasy, unholy alliance is starting to come apart.” “It's starting to come apart over like, should your people have health care or not? Should you defend people from an affordability crisis or not?” he added. “It's coming apart over Epstein. It's coming apart over basic questions of whether this is a liberal democracy or not; and you are actually starting to see moments of courage and moments of people realizing that there is life for them on the far side of Donald Trump, that they may still be here when he's not.”""People actually coming back to their senses in certain cases, or in this case, Donald Trump having better instincts about, you know, maybe not caring about people is not the best way to win elections,” he added. - YouTube youtu.be",https://www.rawstory.com/trump-unholy-alliance-crumbles/,Domestic U.S. Politics & Policy

Steve Bannon urges Trump admin to court martial former NASA astronaut,"MAGA podcaster and former White House chief strategist Steve Bannon is daring Secretary of Defense Pete Hegeseth to make good on his threats and to court martial Sen. Mark Kelly (D-AZ) after Kelly appeared in a video with five other Democrats telling members of the military they have a legal right and obligation to refuse illegal orders Mediaite reports.Kelly is a former NASA astronaut and a decorated U.S. Navy combat veteran who served for 25 years, retiring with the rank of Captain. Bannon argued Wednesday on his WarRoom podcast that Hegseth's ordering a review of Kelly over his statement is not enough.“We’ve got to stop messing around! Kelly’s got to be recalled. We don’t need to wait until 10, December, Pete,” Bannon said. “It’s pretty obvious what [Kelly] did. Just recall him back to active duty and let’s convene a court martial. Let’s roll.”Hegseth demanded the Navy secretary review Kelly’s comments in a recent video featuring him and other Democratic lawmakers for “potentially unlawful conduct"" by December 10.Bannon said that deadline was ""way too long,"" adding, “Do it today. We don’t need the secretary of the Navy involved. The secretary of war should just do it.”Bannon, who served as an officer in the United States Navy for seven years, from 1976 to 1983, also said Kelly should be recalled to active duty (something that can be done for a court martial, but it is rare) Wednesday, a court martial should be convened as soon as Monday, Mediaite reports.Kelly, who fired back at President Donald Trump's Truth Social tirade in which he said the Democrats in the video should be jailed and put on trial for “seditious behavior,"" and that such behavior is “punishable by death,"" has accused the administration of trying to “intimidate” him and others by having the FBI interview all of them.“My wife, Gabby Giffords, was nearly assassinated — shot in the head at a political even,” Kelly told MS NOW. “We have rising political violence in this country, even the president — two assassination attempts.

Bizarre situation': Reporter says Trump plans to replace Patel despite White House claims,"The White House has denied its plans to replace FBI Director Kash Patel, despite insiders who maintain that President Donald Trump says Patel's days are numbered. Journalist Ken Dilanian told MS NOW's Ana Cabrera that he and his colleagues Carol Leonnig and Laura Barrón-López are hearing that ""President Trump has grown increasingly frustrated with the bad press that Kash Patel has been getting about his use of taxpayer resources, including the FBI jet to fly around his girlfriend and provision of a security detail for his girlfriend, the country singer Alexis Wilkins, and also for some of his premature tweeting on some key investigations."" The ""unflattering headlines"" about Patel have reportedly prompted Trump to confide in his allies about his concerns over the embarrassing stories. ""But we're in this bizarre situation where the White House and White House spokespeople in the DOJ and the FBI are all denouncing the story and saying that it's absolutely false where behind the scenes we're being told that it's accurate and that despite what Donald Trump is saying, there still are plans eventually to replace Kash Patel with Andrew Bailey, who is serving as right now deputy FBI director,"" Dilanian said. Bailey is the former Missouri attorney general. It's unclear when Patel could potentially get booted from his post.""Now, when that will happen and whether the reporting of these concerns has changed the dynamic at all, that remains to be seen. But the concerns are real. And Kash Patel really has drawn the ire of a lot of people inside the Trump administration for the way he has been conducting himself and running the FBI,"" Dilanian added.",https://www.rawstory.com/bizarre-situation-analyst-says-trump-plans-to-replace-patel-despite-white-house-claims/,Domestic U.S. Politics & Policy
