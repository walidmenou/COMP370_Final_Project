Controversy erupts over Madani’s ‘discrimination against Muslims’ remark; BJP hits back,"New Delhi: A political controversy has erupted over claims of discrimination faced by Muslims in India after Jamiat Ulema-e-Hind president Maulana Arshad Madani highlighted the struggles of those from the minority community, even in getting appointments to Universities. Madani alleged that Muslims like Samajwadi Party (SP) leader Azam Khan are jailed even if they achieve something. His remarks have drawn massive criticism from the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), which has highlighted its attempts to revere Muslim figures like former President Abdul Kalam and iconic tabla player Zakir Hussain. Maharashtra Chief Minister Devendra Fadnavis on Sunday dismissed the remarks made by Jamiat Ulema-e-Hind President Maulana Arshad Madani, and said that people like former President Abdul Kalam should be presented as an “icon” for the Muslims community. “India had a President like Abdul Kalam, who is a true icon for the Muslim community. We bow our heads in respect to him. He always lived his life with his head held high; he should be presented as a role model,” Fadnavis told reporters in Nagpur. BJP leader Syed Shahnawaz Hussain described Madani’s remarks as “irresponsible” and said they were particularly unexpected from an organisation with a historic legacy. “Jamiat Ulama-i-Hind was part of India’s independence movement, and we did not expect a statement of such stature from them,” Hussain said in a public response. Hussain asserted that the statement was misleading and did not reflect the opportunities available to Indian Muslims under the Constitution. “An Indian Muslim can be India’s President, can be the captain of the Indian hockey team, or can be a Chief Justice of India. An Indian Muslim rightfully has the opportunity to attain any position that the Constitution grants him,” he said. Bihar Minister Mohd Zama Khan on Sunday negated the remarks made by Jamiat Ulema-e-Hind president Maulana Arshad Madani regarding the treatment of Muslims, and said that they are respected everywhere. Speaking to ANI, Khan said that leaders in Bihar have never given “step-motherly” treatment to any community. “If we talk about Bihar, the leaders we work with have never treated any community step-motherly. They talk about taking everyone along. Certainly, in the coming days, under the leadership we have in Bihar, we will take everyone along. The Muslim community gets respect everywhere, and development work is definitely done for them as well,” the Bihar Minister said. Meanwhile, Congress leader Rashid Alvi advocated for action against those “spreading terror and breaking the law”, and advised against “destroying” an entire university. “Take strict action against those who are responsible, terrorists, spreading terror, breaking the law. Whoever they are, it does not mean that you destroy the entire university. How can you do that? Whatever Arshad Madani said is correct to some extent,” Alvi told ANI. The Congress leader recalled and criticised the “won’t allow any Khan to become Mayor” statement made earlier by Mumbai Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) president Ameet Satam. Alvi questioned whether it was the BJP or the public that decided on the same. “Before what he said, a senior BJP leader from Maharashtra had said that we will not allow any Muslim to become the Mayor of Mumbai. How can you say that? The decision will be taken by the BJP or the public?” Alvi said. National Human Rights Commission (NHRC) member Priyank Kanoongo on November 23 criticised Arshad Madani, terming his recent remarks “radical and opportunistic” and accusing him of attempting to mislead Indian Muslims for personal political gains. Speaking in Delhi, Kanoongo alleged that “radical forces” in the country are damaging the social fabric and warned that such actions should not be allowed. “His statement is radical and opportunistic. With such remarks, he is trying to mislead Indian Muslims and use them for his personal political agenda. Radical forces in India are damaging our social fabric. This should not happen,” the NHRC member said. “The country understands his motives. They don’t have any connection with the good for their religion; they are just deceiving people for many years, radicalising them,” he added. Union Minister Giriraj Singh said, “Madani Sahab has always been in a rebellious mood from the beginning. He always gives provocative statements. It seems that these people are supporters of Jinnah. People like Abdul Kalam and Zakir Husain are our ideals. Such language does not befit Madani Sahab. This country will never accept those who give provocative speeches.” Arshad Madani on Saturday expressed concerns about the challenges faced by Muslims, highlighting what he described as discrimination against Muslims in India, pointing to issues such as the jailing of individuals like Azam Khan and the situation at Al-Falah University. He contrasted the situation in India with the election of Muslim mayors in cities like New York (Zohran Mamdani) and London (Sadiq Khan), to counter the notion that Muslims globally have become “helpless, finished, and barren”. He claimed that “no Muslim can become a university vice-chancellor” and if they become “they will be sent to jail,” while referring to government actions against Al Falah University, following the involvement of their doctors in the Delhi terror attack. “The world thinks that Muslims have become helpless, finished, and barren. I don’t believe so. Today, a Muslim Mamdani can become mayor of New York, a Khan can become mayor of London, whereas in India, no one can even become a university vice-chancellor. And even if someone does, they will be sent to jail, as Azam Khan was. Look at what is happening today in Al-Falah (University),” he said. Additionally, Arshad Madani accused the government of “ensuring that they (Muslim) never raise their heads.” (ANI)"

Scoop: Democrats eye ranked-choice voting for 2028 primaries,"Democratic politicians and activists are quietly lobbying to upend the way the party picks its presidential nominee by urging the use of ranked-choice voting.It's a tool that drew national attention when it propelled New York City Mayor-elect Zohran Mamdani to a decisive primary win.Driving the news: Democratic National Committee chair Ken Martin and other top party officials have met privately with advocates who are pushing for the voting method to be expanded for the 2028 presidential primaries, three sources tell Axios.Rep. Jamie Raskin (D-Md.), Joe Biden pollster Celinda Lake, the nonprofit FairVote Action and other Democrats pitched the idea at a late October meeting, the sources said.Zoom in: Supporters of the change — which would allow voters to rank candidates in order of preference — told those at a DNC breakfast gathering in D.C. that it would strengthen and unite the party.They said it would prevent people's votes from being ""wasted"" after presidential candidates drop out, and encourage coalition-building among contenders — an attention-grabbing pitch in light of the party's divisive primaries in 2016 and 2020.The idea has gotten a mixed response within the DNC. ""I'm totally open to ranked-choice voting,"" one committee member said.A second DNC member was more skeptical: ""We should follow the lead of the states. They know better.""Critics say it would increase waiting times at the polls and be a logistical quagmire. Others argue it would lengthen the primary, for better or worse.For the DNC to approve the use of ranked-choice voting in primaries, it would need the support of the powerful rules and bylaws committee and a majority of the 450-member body. State parties also would need to OK it, and many states would need to amend their election laws.What they're saying: ""It favors positive politics rather than negative politics, and that's a great thing for the Democratic Party primaries,"" Raskin told Axios. ""Oftentimes there's a sense of acrimony and bitterness that can last decades. Think about the race between Hillary and Bernie Sanders.""Lake told us: ""It gives a better chance to new faces, outsider candidates, people with grassroots movements, people who run positive campaigns, people who have something new to offer. It really meets the moment.""A DNC spokesperson declined to comment.Zoom out: The push to shape how and when voters cast their ballots — and how votes are assessed — is part of the early wrangling over the rules of the primary contests.Internal debates over the primary calendar — namely which states vote early in the primaries — are another key part of that dance.Besides New York City, states and localities that have adopted ranked-choice voting include Alaska, Maine, San Francisco and Minneapolis."

Are cities finally waking up to the housing crisis?,"In one respect, New York City’s unusual election results this year fit a national pattern: Voters opted to make housing easier and faster to build. Here’s hoping it’s a trend that lasts. A lack of housing has become a nationwide problem. High prices and mortgage rates have depressed sales. With rent costs outpacing incomes, nearly half the nation’s growing population of renters pays more than 30 percent of their income on housing. In New York, the rental vacancy rate has plummeted to 1.4 percent and the homeless population has soared. At long last, voters seem to be waking up to a problem that research identified decades ago: Policies that protect existing homeowners and other local interests have restricted development and driven up costs. New Yorkers voted to speed up reviews of affordable housing and other modest projects and weaken local council members’ veto power. A zoning reform last year, the city’s biggest since 1961, followed similar proposals in fast-growing cities such as Austin and Minneapolis. California’s governor is overriding mayoral opposition to apartme"

Mamdani and Trump Tamp Down Fears Over National Guard in New York City,Mamdani and Trump Tamp Down Fears Over National Guard in New York City
Can progressives ride Mamdani’s momentum into the midterms?,"House Democrats are bracing for a surge of progressive primary challenges that could scramble the party’s internal hierarchy—and the spark behind it all is a likely one: New York City Mayor-elect Zohran Mamdani.Something on the left has shifted. From municipal offices to congressional districts, activists are testing whether the anti-establishment energy that helped elect Mamdani can be scaled up to Washington.New York City Mayor-elect Zohran MamdaniRep. Mark Pocan of Wisconsin, former Progressive Caucus co-chair, initially guessed that “at least 30%” of House Democrats would face primary challenges this cycle. Speaking to Axios this week, he increased that estimate. “That number might turn out to be even higher,” he said. “You can just tell. It’s the year. People’s hair is on fire; they just feel like they’ve got to do something. People are pissed, they’re sad, they’re concerned.”Nowhere is the jolt more attention-grabbing than in Brooklyn, where House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries suddenly has a potential challenger. New York City Council member Chi Ossé filed paperwork Monday—an underdog bid that nonetheless ricocheted through political circles because of his past ties to Mamdani.Yet Mamdani himself is urging restraint. At a Democratic Socialists of America meeting Wednesday night, he urged members not to endorse Ossé, underscoring divisions inside the progressive universe.“The choice is not whether to vote for Chi or Hakeem at the ballot box; the choice is how to spend the next year. Do we want to spend it defending caricatures of our movement, or do we want to spend it fulfilling the agenda at the heart of that very same movement?” Mamdani reportedly said.Democratic Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York, herself a veteran insurgent who toppled incumbent Joe Crowley in 2018, offered a similar warning.“I certainly don’t think a primary challenge to the leader is a good thing right now,” she said.What these comments reveal is less hesitation than calibration. For many on the left, Mamdani’s win wasn’t just about ideology; it was about method. Democratic Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New YorkAn insistence on grassroots accountability and genuine bottom-up organizing has become central to his political identity. To progressives, that approach feels like a necessary correction after years of insider-driven party management that helped produce the Democratic wipeouts of 2024.Even if Ossé ultimately falls short, he is far from alone. A wave of insurgent candidates is emerging. Chuck Park, a former New York Economic Development Corporation staffer, launched a challenge against Rep. Grace Meng on Monday. And Michael Blake, a former state assembly member and Democratic National Committee vice chair, is taking on Rep. Ritchie Torres.More possible bids are floating around Manhattan and Brooklyn—territory where Mamdani’s victory map now functions as a kind of strategic blueprint. Names like Comptroller Brad Lander and Council member Alexa Avilés are being discussed as potential rivals to Rep. Dan Goldman, whose district Mamdani carried with ease.“Brad Lander will win,” outgoing Rep. Jerry Nadler told Axios. He later dialed back the certainty: “I really don’t know who’s going to win.”The progressive insurgency is national in scope. Reps. Shri Thanedar of Michigan, Wesley Bell of Missouri, and Jimmy Gomez of California are facing challengers backed by Justice Democrats, the same left-wing group that helped unseat incumbents during the last wave of progressive upsets.Older Democrats are also under pressure. Reps. Ed Case of Hawaii, Steve Cohen of Tennessee, and David Scott of Georgia face younger rivals questioning both their ideology and their age. Primary challenges have also emerged against Reps. Nancy Pelosi of California—who is retiring—and Jan Schakowsky of Illinois, with critics arguing that senior party leaders failed to confront Trump aggressively enough or offer a compelling vision for the future.Democratic Rep. Nancy Pelosi of California, who announced that she will not seek reelection in 2026.Speaking anonymously to Axios, one House Democrat dubbed the pattern “the Mamdani revolution,” while another stressed that, even if many insurgents fall short, ignoring the momentum would be a mistake.“Anybody who doesn’t take the dynamic seriously does so at their peril. It’s going to be a bloodbath in comparison to a default year,” they said.Justice Democrats confirmed that they plan to build on Mamdani’s victory—a sign that more progressive campaigns are coming. “You can expect more news on that in the coming weeks,” a spokesperson told Axios.What’s emerging is a larger confrontation over how power is won and wielded inside the Democratic Party. For years, the party relied on a top-down model that left many voters alienated or unheard. Now those same voters are speaking in the only language politics reliably understands: competitive primaries. A new generation of candidates—hungry, networked, and unapologetically ambitious—is forcing Democrats to reckon with a future that won’t wait for permission."

"Tick, Tick , Tick: Study Shows California Losing A Taxpayer Every Minute","Tick, Tick , Tick: Study Shows California Losing A Taxpayer Every Minute Authored by Jonathan Turley,California is facing a perfect storm in finances, with a crippling deficit and a declining tax base.Now, a study of IRS data by the National Taxpayers Union Foundation found that California is losing a taxpayer roughly every minute, as states like Florida, Texas, and North Carolina attract new residents due to lower taxes and higher standards of living.In comparison, Florida gains a new taxpayer every 2 minutes and 9 seconds while Texas gains one every 2 minutes and 53 seconds.The result has been a bonanza for Florida, which is now collecting $4 billion more per year for its budget.The states losing taxpayers at the fastest rate are California, New York, and Illinois. Here is the rate of loss:California: every 1 minute and 44 secondsNew York: every 2 minutes and 23 secondsIllinois: every 6 minutes and 4 seconds.Massachusetts: every 11 minutes and 38 secondsNew Jersey: every 14 minutes and 14 seconds.These remain high-tax states where there are even greater demands for tax increases (particularly in Illinois, California, and New York) as well as new spending demands. In Illinois, Mayor Brandon Johnson is pushing for disastrous new taxes, while in New York, incoming Zohran Mamdani is demanding new taxes to fund his free buses and other campaign promises.In Seattle, socialist Katie Wilson won the mayoral election on the promise of new “progressive taxes” to fund an assortment of programs.In Oregon, as Democratic politicians run on the rise in the cost of living, they just approved a gas tax hike as part of $4 billion tax and charge increases. They may be hoping that the decline in gas costs this year will make the tax less noticeable, but some citizens are pushing to place it on the ballot for voters.In these states and cities, the assumption is that wealthy people will remain as voluntary game in a type of fiscal canned hunt as politicians discuss new wealth and other forms of taxes. They are not. They are leaving with their wealth and their tax payments.Unions continue to push for these new taxes as high-tax-paying residents leave these states. At the same time, California and Illinois continue to push their status as sanctuary states, increasing the public burden for schools, hospitals and other programs. As they increase spending and their tax base contracts, the outcome is obvious.Again, take California. The state experienced a $9 billion decline in taxpayer funds during 2018. That number increased to $29 billion lost in 2020.As I discuss in my forthcoming book, Rage and the Republic: The Unfinished Story of the American Revolution, there is a common myth that the top five percent of this country do not “pay their fair share.” However, putting that debate aside, the question is whether it will produce more revenue than it costs the state in the long run. As these politicians campaign on clipping the “fat cats” who are not paying their fair share, many are likely to follow the exodus to lower tax states with greater fiscal discipline.There are many in states like Florida and Texas who worry that new residents from states like New York and California will replicate their prior voting patterns and produce the same disastrous policies in their new states. I just spoke in Boise, Idaho where many are complaining that Californians are moving to the state and adopting the same policies that produced the conditions that they just left behind. The fear is that the voters will not be willing to vote for conservatives or libertarians and simply move like a liberal diaspora from state to state as they reproduce prior tax and fiscal policies.Time will tell. However, what is clear is that Democratic states are not showing any greater fiscal discipline as they careen toward budget meltdowns. Tyler DurdenSun, 11/23/2025 - 16:20"

Why Zohran Mamdani Still Feels Trump is a Fascist: NYC Mayor Reveals What They Discussed at White House,Mamdani and Donald Trump met at the White House on Friday
House Votes To Denounce Socialism Despite Widespread Dem Opposition,"House Votes To Denounce Socialism Despite Widespread Dem Opposition The U.S. House of Representatives passed a bipartisan resolution condemning socialism on Friday. The resolution, introduced about a month ago by Rep. Maria Salazar (R-FL), explicitly denounces socialism in all its forms and rejects the implementation of socialist policies in America. The bill cites ""more than 100 million deaths at the hands of socialist governments."" Republicans hailed the vote as an easy moral stand against a system that “crushes the human soul.”While 86 Democrats broke ranks to support the condemnation, 98 Democrats opposed the resolution, which passed 285-98. In a 2023 vote, 109 Democrats voted to condemn while 86 voted against it and 14 Democrats voted present. This vote came hours before New York City Mayor-elect Zohran Mamdani, a self-proclaimed democratic socialist, arrived in Washington, D.C., to meet with President Donald Trump for the first time. Among the 86 Democrats who supported the measure were 14 congressmembers from New York and New Jersey, including House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries, who only endorsed Mamdani in the 11th hour of the mayoral race.Other New Yorkers who also supported the measure included Rep. Ritchie Torres of the Bronx, Reps. Greg Meeks and Grace Meng of Queens, and Reps. Laura Gillen and Tom Suozzi of Long Island. Suozzi made a special point of distancing himself from Mamdani during the mayoral campaign.The measure was also supported by Republican Staten Island Rep. Nicole Malliotakis, whose mother fled Cuba in 1959. She said her mother left Cuba to avoid what she called ""the very things that our new socialist mayor in New York City says he wants."" -CBS NewsDemocrats voting against the resolution included Rep. Maxine Waters of California, who denounced it as a distraction. ""I wish we were here on the House floor this morning debating solutions that would reduce grocery bills, lower housing costs, end Trump's tariffs strangling American small businesses and manufacturers, solve the Republican health care crisis, or any legislation that allows Americans to afford [to] live through the catastrophic economic policies of Trump and the Republicans,"" she said, even though symbolic resolutions are common in the House.Republicans weren’t buying it.“100 Democrats just refused to condemn the horrors of socialism,” Rep. Andy Biggs (R-AZ) said in a post on X. “There were no poison pills in this resolution. There are 100+ socialism sympathizers in the United States House of Representatives. Despicable.”100 Democrats just refused to condemn the horrors of socialism.There were no poison pills in this resolution.There are 100+ socialism sympathizers in the United States House of Representatives.Despicable. pic.twitter.com/v62W5ZcCtD— Rep Andy Biggs (@RepAndyBiggsAZ) November 21, 2025“If you needed proof that the left has gone completely insane, here it is,” Congressman Russell Fry (R-S.C) said. Of note, across five votes to denounce socialism since 2009, two were unanimous and three were not - including the aforementioned 2023 vote in which 86 Democrats voted against it.Mamdani dismissed the resolution as irrelevant when asked about it in the Oval Office.""I have to be honest with you, I focused very little on resolutions. Frankly, I've been focusing ... on the work at hand,"" he claimed. ""I can tell you, I am someone who is a democratic socialist. I've been very open about that. And I know there might be differences about ideology, but the place of agreement is the work that needs to be done to make New York City affordable. That's what I look forward to.""While some may consider this to be nothing more than an ideological purity test, Mamdani's election - and the results of this vote, clearly indicate the direction of the pendulum.

"Mamdani: Trump's a fascist, but I'll work with him","New York City Mayor-elect Zohran Mamdani said in an interview aired Sunday he still believes President Trump is a fascist and a threat to democracy, even as he pledged to work with him to deliver for New Yorkers.The big picture: Even in recent months, Trump threatened to arrest Mamdani and starve New York of federal funding. By Friday, they were bonding over rent prices and grocery costs in the Oval Office.Driving the news: Asked if Trump had assured him he wouldn't send troops into the city, Mamdani said on NBC's ""Meet the Press"" that he made it ""very clear what we wanted to do was to deliver public safety and affordability, and the NYPD would be the ones to do so.""He said he told the president during their Friday meeting that ""what separates New York City from anywhere else in the country is we have the NYPD,"" which Mamdani said he trusted to ""deliver public safety.""The comments came after Mamdani's first trip to the Oval Office as mayor-elect, where he and the president emphasized common ground on tackling the city's affordability crisis.Catch up quick: Mamdani, the city's first Muslim elected mayor, has cast Trump as a threat to both the city and the country.Mamdani's meteoric rise further fueled the president's focus on his hometown as the GOP cast the democratic socialist as a far-left bogeyman, falsely calling him a communist.Trump had threatened to have Mamdani arrested if New York blocked federal immigration officials from detaining undocumented immigrants and said he'd withhold federal funding from a city that receives billions in federal dollars each year.In August, amid a National Guard crackdown and police takeover in D.C., the president said New York City would be one of his next targets.Yes, but: That was before a cheery Trump praised and defended the ""very rational"" Mamdani, saying during their Oval Office Q&A that they agreed on ""a lot more than I would have thought.""On Saturday, Trump said he would still deploy the National Guard to New York City ""if they need it,"" but added that, for now, ""other places need it more.""Zoom out: National Economic Council director Kevin Hassett also signaled Sunday on CNN's ""State of the Union"" that Trump is, at least for now, backing off threats to cut the city's funding.""I guess we'll have to wait and see what Mamdani does,"" he said. ""I think that we are really reassured that we've kept the police commissioner.""Mamdani said he will retain police commissioner Jessica Tisch, whom the mayor-elect applauded Sunday for her leadership in combatting crime and corruption.Friction point: Trump and Mamdani's surprise congeniality does not mean months of tensions are simply wiped away.Mamdani reiterated in the ""Meet the Press"" interview, ""Everything that I've said in the past, I continue to believe. And that's the thing that I think is important in our politics, is that we don't shy away from where we have disagreements, but we understand what it is that brings us to that table.""Go deeper: Inside Trump and Mamdani's surprising bond of convenience"

Trump Reportedly Preparing To Designate Muslim Brotherhood As Foreign Terrorist Org,"Trump Reportedly Preparing To Designate Muslim Brotherhood As Foreign Terrorist Org John Solomon's Just The News reports, in an exclusive interview with President Trump on Sunday morning, that the president will formally designate the Muslim Brotherhood (MB) as a foreign terrorist organization.Trump explained that the MB's FTO designation will be imminent and drafted ""in the strongest and most powerful terms,"" adding, ""Final documents are being drawn.""MB was founded in Egypt nearly a century ago with branches across the Middle East, Africa, Europe, and the U.S. The org has been outlawed or labeled a terrorist group by several governments, including Egypt, Jordan, Saudi Arabia, the UAE, and Bahrain. Trump has weighed the FTO designation since his first term, and his comments come days after Texas Gov. Greg Abbott and Attorney General Ken Paxton designated the Council on American-Islamic Relations (CAIR) as an FTO and transnational criminal organization.Abbott's proclamation authorized ""heightened penalties"" against CAIR and the Muslim Brotherhood and prohibited both entities from acquiring land in Texas, alleging that CAIR had ""repeatedly employed, affiliated with, and supported individuals promoting terrorism-related activities.""GOP officials, including Sen. Tom Cotton (R-Ark.) and Rep. Elise Stefanik (R-N.Y.), have requested that the Treasury Department probe CAIR's financial networks.In August, Secretary of State Marco Rubio confirmed that the FTO designation was being prepared, though the process is complex because of MB's sprawling network of affiliates.We introduced the Muslim Brotherhood Is a T*rrorist Organization Act because it’s time to call it what it is, a jihadist network fueling t*rrorism.While radicals like Zohran Mamdani cozy up to extremists tied to Islamic t*rrorists and Hamas, we’re putting AMERICA FIRST and... pic.twitter.com/5atqKgRqkX— Rep.

Mamdani says he still believes Trump is a ‘fascist' and ‘despot' after meeting,"New York City Mayor-elect Zohran Mamdani says in a new interview with NBC’S “Meet the Press” that he still believes President Donald Trump is a “fascist” and a “despot,” but he viewed their first face-to-face meeting at the White House on Friday as an “opportunity” to work together on lowering the cost of living for New Yorkers.After months of trading insults during the campaign, the two were friendly during the meeting, with the president telling reporters he’ll be “cheering” for Mamdani, and the mayor-elect calling the meeting “productive.”Following their meeting, Mamdani was asked by reporters if he stood by his decision to call Trump a “fascist” during his campaign.“That’s OK, you can just say it,” Trump told him, jokingly. “It’s easier, it’s easier than explaining it.”In the interview, which was recorded Saturday and aired Sunday, Mamdani told “Meet the Press” moderator Kristen Welker that he does still believe the president is a fascist.“After President Trump said that, I said, ‘Yes,’” Mamdani said.He added, “That’s something I’ve said in the past and I say today. And I think what I appreciated about the conversation that I had with the president was that we were not shy about the places of disagreement, about the politics that has brought us to this moment, and we also wanted to focus on what it could look like to deliver on a shared analysis of an affordability crisis for New Yorkers.”Mamdani referenced other past negative comments about Trump, telling Welker, “Everything that I’ve said in the past, I continue to believe.”“I’m not coming into the Oval Office to make a point or make a stand. I’m coming in there to deliver for New Yorkers,” he added.The mayor-elect also spoke about his attitude going into the meeting and why it ended up so friendly.“I thought again and again about what it would mean for New Yorkers if we could establish a productive relationship that would focus on the issues that those New Yorkers stay up late at night thinking about,” rather than keep trading barbs, Mamdani told Welker.“When you actually ask New Yorkers and you listen to them, you hear it come back to the issues that animated not just the conversation the president and I had with the press after our meeting, but frankly, in the meeting itself,” Mamdani added.New York City Mayor-elect Zohran Mamdani appearing on Sunday’s “Meet the Press” with Kristen Welker (NBC)The mayor-elected pointed to Trump’s own campaign message last year, which included promises to lower costs for Americans on Day 1 of his second term.On Saturday, Mamdani said he went out of his way during the mayoral campaign to speak to New Yorkers living in the Bronx and Queens who had voted for Trump in 2024.“I shared with the president that when I asked those New Yorkers why did they vote for the president, they told me again and again, it was cost of living, cost of living, cost of living,” the mayor-elect said. “And when the president and I were speaking, we were speaking about what is preventing from delivering on that affordability agenda.”In the weeks leading up to Election Day, Trump frequently bashed Mamdani online, calling him a “communist lunatic” and threatening to cut off federal funding for New York City if voters elected Mamdani, who refers to himself as a democratic socialist. Mamdani often shot back, once calling Trump a “despot.”On Friday, after reporters asked the pair about that particular insult, the president said, “I’ve been called much worse than a despot,” adding, “I think he’ll change his mind after we get to working together.”On the eve of the election, Trump even endorsed Mamdani’s strongest opponent, former New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo, a Democrat-turned-independent who ran in the general election after losing to Mamdani in the Democratic primary.In his victory speech, Mamdani spoke forcefully against the Trump administration, promising that “New York will be the light” in political darkness and telling Trump to “turn the volume up.”Mamdani said Saturday that he and the president also spoke about Trump’s threats to send National Guard troops into New York City, as he’s done in several other major Democratic-led cities in recent months.Mamdani didn’t answer questions about whether Trump ruled out the possibility of sending troops to New York City, but said, “What I told him is that what separates New York City from anywhere else in the country is we have the NYPD, and I trust the NYPD to deliver public safety, and to me, that is something that I know that they can do, that they have done, and they will continue to do under my leadership.”Asked at the White House on Saturday whether he planned to send troops to New York City, Trump said simply, “If they need it.”“Right now, other places need it more, but if they need — we had a very good meeting yesterday. We talked about that, but if they need it, I would do it,” Trump told reporters.One of Mamdani’s key campaign promises was to raise taxes on the city’s highest earners to fund key policy objectives. To do so, he’ll need the blessing of Democratic Gov. Kathy Hochul and state legislators in Albany.The mayor-elect didn’t answer questions about whether Hochul has committed to helping him raise taxes, but said the two are both committed to making New York City more affordable.“I think she’ll work with me to deliver on affordability. I think raising taxes make the most sense,” Mamdani said. “If there’s any alternatives that raise the same amount of money, I’m open.”On Saturday, Mamdani also spoke about his relationship with the nation’s Democratic leaders.In the months leading up to the election, many were hesitant to endorse the self-described democratic socialist. Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., never endorsed Mamdani, and House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries, D-N.Y., only did so less than two weeks before Election Day.Still, Mamdani last week urged members of New York’s Democratic Socialists of America chapter not to endorse a primary challenger to Jeffries.And on Saturday, Mamdani told “Meet the Press” that he supports Jeffries becoming the speaker of the House if Democrats retake the majority in the 2026 midterm elections.Mamdani also spoke about his conversation with former President Barack Obama after his victory, saying the two spoke about “the importance of what it looks like, not only to inspire hope, but to sustain it, and then to deliver on it.”Alexandra Marquez is a politics reporter for NBC News."

"Trump's not cutting off NYC, White House economic advisor says","The White House is reassured by New York City Mayor-elect Zohran Mamdani, and President Trump doesn't appear inclined to cut the city's funding, National Economic Council director Kevin Hassett said Sunday.Why it matters: Only three weeks ago Trump was threatening to largely block federal funds to America's largest city if Mamdani, a Muslim socialist immigrant, was elected mayor.But on Friday, Trump had nothing but warm words and positive wishes for Mamdani after their Oval Office meeting.What they're saying: Hassett, in an interview on CNN's ""State of the Union,"" was asked if Trump had really meant his threats to cut off the city.""Well, it feels like he doesn't mean it now, and I guess we'll have to wait and see what Mamdani does. I think that we are really reassured that we've kept the police commissioner,"" Hassett said.Context: Earlier this week, Mamdani said he would retain police commissioner Jessica Tisch, who's been credited with strong leadership since taking over the NYPD a year ago. Trump's daughter Ivanka is reportedly a ""good friend"" of Tisch's.""New York always feels like safety is on the edge, and so the fact that Mamdani as mayor has agreed to keep the police commissioner is a kind of sign that he'll maybe be able to work together with President Trump,"" Hassett said.Yes, but: Trump may be warmer on Mamdani, Hassett said, but that doesn't mean he's ready to line up behind the incoming mayor's boldest pledges, like opening city-run grocery stores and making all buses free to ride.""None of those really jump off the page for me as really strong ideas,"" Hassett said, adding there were still opportunities for the two to work together.The bottom line: Trump's threats appear to have gone by the wayside, at least for now."

"TV Host Says Trump ‘Obviously In Love With Mamdani,’ And Her Guest Has A Theory Why","President Donald Trump and Zohran Mamadani have a delightful meeting, a shocking turn from the tension during the New York City mayoral raceMS NOW host Nicolle Wallace was taken aback after watching President Donald Trump’s gushing treatment of New York City’s Mayor-elect Zohran Mamdani in front of the press on Friday night during Mamdani’s visit to the White House. “Even with Putin, Trump didn’t go on for as long where he lavished that much praise, affection and admiration on anyone,” Wallace told her guest, Fast Politics podcast host Molly Jong-Fast, on Friday.Trump congratulated Mamdani, a harsh and outspoken critic of the president, for his mayoral win during their highly anticipated meeting, praising him and offering words of encouragement. It was quite the shift from the tone Trump took during the mayoral race, when he labeled Mamdani a “communist lunatic.”“The better he does, the happier I am, I will say,” Trump said on Friday. “There’s no difference in party, there’s no difference in anything. And we’re going to be helping him to make everybody’s dream come true, having a strong and very safe New York. And congratulations, Mr Mayor.”Jong-Fast shared a theory with Wallace: Trump saw the popularity of Mamdani and his economics-focused messaging, and Trump “wants to get on that affordability train.”“He sees his numbers. He knows inflation is plaguing him. I mean, maybe I’m ascribing too much sort of political acumen to him,” she said.With Trump pushing lies about inflation and grocery prices, a recent Reuters/Ipsos poll shows that his Republican voters are beginning to slip away from him over his handling of the economy, sliding from an 87% approval rating among the group earlier this month to 82%.“I think that it speaks to the talent, the political talent, the raw political talent that Zohran has, that he can go in and sit there and just make this guy his greatest cheerleader,” Jong-Fast said. “But I also wonder if he’s trying to get on that, you know, he ran as a populist. He said he was going to make things cheaper.”Wallace agreed that Trump was “obviously tracking” Mamdani’s poll numbers. “So Trump is endorsing Cuomo, is flipping Adams, or whatever the hell he did, with the Adams criminal bribery case at DOJ,” she continued. “And I wonder how those lawyers feel about ruining their integrity to spring Adams, when Trump was obviously in love with Mamdani the whole time.“And the guy is sitting there saying, ‘You can call me a fascist or despot, you just answer the question.’” she added. “I’ve never seen him sort of care for his children, his vice president or his cabinet’s credibility the way he seemed committed to honouring Mamdani’s credibility.”Related...Social Media Erupts Over Trump Telling Mamdani It's OK To Call Him One 7-Letter WordTrump Praises Zohran Mamdani: 'You're Gonna Have, Hopefully, A Really Great Mayor'Smiles Between Trump & Mamdani"
Trump Reacts To Marjorie Taylor Greene’s Resignation By Doubling Down On Insults,"Donald Trump and Marjorie Taylor Greene.President Donald Trump on Saturday reacted to the sudden resignation of Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene (Republican, Georgia), a week after he publicly pulled support from the longtime MAGA ally.Greene announced her official departure from Congress in a video on Friday. Trump first reacted to her exit by phone on that same night, telling ABC News White House correspondent Rachel Scott, “I think it’s great news for the country. It’s great.” The president started posting on social media earlier than usual Saturday, doubling down on his joy.“Marjorie ‘Traitor’ Brown, because of PLUMMETING Poll Numbers, and not wanting to face a Primary Challenger with a strong Trump Endorsement (where she would have no chance of winning!), has decided to call it ‘quits,’” he wrote on Truth Social at 6:45 a.m..Greene has accused the president of turning on her because of her continued call to release classified documents related to late sex trafficker and Trump friend Jeffrey Epstein. He has meanwhile accused her of going “Far Left” and claimed that she calls him too much.“For some reason, primarily that I refused to return her never ending barrage of phone calls, Marjorie went BAD,” he wrote in his Saturday screed.He also took aim at two Kentucky Republicans, Rep. Thomas Massie and Senator Rand Paul. Massie filed the discharge petition to a force a vote on the release of the Epstein files, while Paul has said he was “on the side of transparency” in the matter.Greene’s “relationship with the WORST Republican Congressman in decades, Tom Massie of Kentucky, also known as Rand Paul Jr. because he votes against the Republican Party (and really good legislation!), did not help her,” Trump wrote.The Georgia congresswoman had broken with Trump not only over his dismissal of the Epstein “hoax,” but also over his handling of the recent government shutdown and lack of a Republican plan to help people who are losing subsidies to afford health insurance policies.My message to Georgia’s 14th district and America.Thank you. pic.twitter.com/tSoHCeAjn1— Marjorie Taylor Greene 🇺🇸 (@mtgreenee) November 22, 2025Trump wrote last week that he would endorse a challenger against her in the midterms.“For some reason, primarily that I refused to return her never ending barrage of phone calls, Marjorie went BAD,” he wrote on Saturday. “Nevertheless, I will always appreciate Marjorie, and thank her for her service to our Country! President DJT.”Greene argued in a statement on Friday that Trump has abandoned the American people.She wrote, “If I am cast aside by MAGA Inc and replaced by Neocons, Big Pharma, Big Tech, Military Industrial Complex, foreign leaders, and the elite donor class that can’t even relate to real Americans, then many common Americans have been cast aside and replaced as well.”Related...Social Media Erupts Over Trump Telling Mamdani It's OK To Call Him One 7-Letter WordPutin's Chilling Response To Trump Peace Plan Shows Why It Is Bad News For UkraineTrump Praises Zohran Mamdani: 'You're Gonna Have, Hopefully, A Really Great Mayor'"
Trump Says It's Totally Fine For Mamdani To Call Him A Fascist: 'That's OK',"President Donald Trump talks after meeting with New York City Mayor-elect Zohran Mamdani in the Oval Office of the White House, Friday, Nov. 21, 2025, in Washington. Although President Donald Trumphyped up his meeting on Friday with New York City Mayor-elect Zohran Mamdani, nothing prepared social media for the exchange between the two of them.And while everyone knew there was a good chance of at least one viral moment, no one expected it would come when Trump told Mamdani it was “OK” for the democratic socialist to call him a fascist.When a New York Post reporter asked Mamdani if he stands by his previous statements that the president is a “despot” who has “betrayed the country” and promotes a “fascist agenda,” Mamdani did not disavow the comments. Instead, he spoke positively about Friday’s meeting and saidhe was focused on the “shared purpose” of serving New Yorkers.Trump, meanwhile, seemed amused by the question and joked, “I’ve been called much worse than a despot. So it’s not that insulting.”Then, after another reporter asked Mamdani if he still considered Trump a fascist, the typically thin-skinned president stopped Mamdani as he attempted a diplomatic response and said it was OK with him if he did.“That’s OK, you can just say yes,” Trump said, to which Mamdani smiled and said, “OK.”“It’s easier than explaining it. I don’t mind,” the president assured Mamdani before patting his arm.You may have to see it below to believe it.Asked to clarify if he thinks Trump is a fascist, before Mamdani can answer, Trump intervenes and laughs it off, saying, “That’s ok. You can just say yes. That’s easier. It’s easier than explaining.” pic.twitter.com/RfKJd6vAs1— Kaitlan Collins (@kaitlancollins) November 21, 2025Trump has frequently attacked socialism, Muslims, and Mamdani himself, even threatening to withhold funding from New York City if the democratic socialist became mayor. So many people on social media were stunned by his apparently cordial meeting with the mayor-elect.

BJP rebuts Jamiat Chief Madani charge that govt works to ensure Muslims “Never raise their heads”,"Bharatiya Janata Party on Sunday strongly criticised Jamiat Ulema-e-Hind president Maulana Arshad Madani for alleging that the Indian government was systematically ensuring Muslims remain marginalised. The party said such statements were “confusing,” “misleading,” and “dangerous,” particularly at a time when the Delhi blast probe is underway and security agencies are on alert. BJP spokesperson Yaser Jilani dismissed Madani’s public address as an attempt to create unnecessary fear within the Muslim community. According to him, the cleric ignored the inclusive policies of the Central government and instead chose to “spread confusion for political gains.” “There cannot be a better place for Muslims than India, nor a better big brother than the Hindus,” Jilani said, adding that Madani’s remarks misrepresented the social reality of India’s pluralistic structure. Jilani Points to Contradictions in Madani’s Statements The BJP also highlighted what it termed “inherent contradictions” in Madani’s speech. Jilani noted that the cleric simultaneously referred to global challenges faced by Muslims and celebrated the rise of leaders like Zohran Mamdani, the Mayor-elect of New York, and London Mayor Sadiq Khan. “He cannot claim that Muslims are helpless globally and in the same breath cite Muslim leaders rising abroad. And in India, he links every legal case with discrimination,” Jilani said, referring specifically to Madani’s mention of Uttar Pradesh leader Azam Khan and developments at Al-Falah University. Jilani reiterated that both cases involved “clear legal violations” and were not examples of targeting. “The owner of Al-Falah University is a perpetrator, and Azam Khan is also involved in various offences. The Central government is taking everyone along. Madani should not create confusion among people,” he added. Maulana Arshad Madani, in his earlier statement, claimed that Muslims were being unfairly targeted in India. He argued that while Muslims abroad could rise to top positions in public life, their counterparts in India were pushed down by political machineries. “The world thinks Muslims have become helpless and barren. But I don’t believe so,” Madani said. “A Muslim Mamdani can become mayor of New York, a Khan can become mayor of London, but in India, even if someone becomes a vice-chancellor, they will be sent to jail. Look at Azam Khan. Look at Al-Falah. The government is working to ensure that Muslims never raise their heads.” His remarks stirred immediate political responses across party lines, with the BJP accusing him of inflaming sentiments and attempting to deepen communal divides. Former Uttar Pradesh Minister and BJP leader Mohsin Raza launched a scathing attack, accusing Madani and his family of decades-long exploitation of the Muslim community. “This has been their dual character for a very long time. Madani and his family kept receiving grants in the name of Muslim minorities but did nothing for their upliftment,” Raza said. He alleged that the cleric’s comments were driven by a political agenda rather than genuine concern. In a contrasting political stance, the Congress extended full support to Maulana Madani. Party leader Udit Raj endorsed the cleric’s remarks and accused the government of discriminatory practices. “I support his statement. Yes, someone may have done terrorist activity in Al-Falah University, but why should the university be targeted? Why are homes of Muslims being bulldozed?” he asked, alleging differential treatment by authorities. Raj also compared India unfavourably with the United States, saying, “America is great as there is no discrimination there.” The political clash once again brings to the fore long-standing arguments over discrimination, legal accountability, and political rhetoric around minority rights. While the BJP asserts that legal action against individuals like Azam Khan or institutions like Al-Falah University has no religious angle, the opposition maintains that selective targeting and bulldozer actions reflect structural bias. With the Delhi blast probe underway and national security dominating discourse, Madani’s remarks have sharpened fault lines within the political landscape. As multiple parties present conflicting narratives, the debate over Muslim representation, political accountability, and social justice is expected to escalate further in the coming days."

Mamdani trumps Trump,"SOME US media comments calling President Donald J. Trump’s meeting with New York City’s mayor-elect Zohran K. Mamdani a ‘bromance’ may be exaggerated, but who’d have predicted that the Oval Office encounter would turn out to be so amicable that it astounded both the Republican Party rank and file and, possibly, even the top guns of the Democratic Party. The president, who had earlier described Mamdani as a “communist”, an “anti-Semite” and a “lunatic”, changed his tune ahead of the young mayor-elect’s White House visit on Friday, saying he expected the meeting to be “cordial”.Only a day earlier, his press secretary Karoline Leavitt told a briefing: “It speaks volumes that tomorrow we have a communist coming to the White House, because that’s who the Democrat Party elected as the mayor of the largest city in the country.”CNN reported that Republican Senator Rick Scott of Florida late on Friday morning called Mamdani a “literal communist” and predicted he was “on his way to the White House to be schooled by President Trump”. The Republicans, CNN said, have spent weeks, even months, suggesting they were preparing to tie Democrats far and wide to Mamdani’s politics. Democrats also seemed to fear this, judging by how reluctant some of them were to endorse him. “This was the GOP’s [Republican Party] first big opportunity to drive that message — to set up this contrast between Trump’s agenda and the purported communism that has infected the national Democratic Party ... Trump trampled all over that strategy.”He must have shocked the Republican Party by rubbishing another one of its major lines of attack that Mamdani is a ‘jihadist’. Trump was asked if he agreed with Republican candidate for New York governor (the vehemently pro-Israel Congresswoman) Elise Stefanik, who made that claim: “No, I don’t”, and attributed her comment to electioneering.Although Mamdani stood respectfully by the president’s side, he demonstrated that he was no pushover.The president also complimented the young New Yorker, who was born when Trump was 45, on his win against some ‘pretty tough’ candidates, and said that the mayor-elect would surprise Republicans by his policies. Not just that, he jumped to his charismatic visitor’s defence when the latter was questioned by reporters on some of his mayoral campaign rhetoric, including calling the White House incumbent a ‘fascist’. This clearly was a change of heart and indicated a reversal of the stance Trump had held since Mamdani entered the race.The obvious question many are asking is why? I asked one New York-based South Asian-origin analyst, who half-jokingly remarked that the mayor-elect seemed to have taken a leaf out of the Pakistan leadership’s playbook by charming him, “killing him with kindnesses”. Continuing on a more serious note, he said that Trump was a narcissist and a bully. Mamdani, who has exceptional emotional intelligence, may have played on both these traits of the president. He may have combined his South Asian charm — reverence for the elderly — with excellent communication skills, to appeal to the 79-year-old’s narcissism, but he also firmly, though politely, made it clear that he was not one to be bullied.Although Mamdani stood respectfully by the president’s side as the latter sat at his desk while speaking to the media, he quickly demonstrated that he was no pushover when asked if he believed whether the US was complicit in what he had called the genocide in Gaza. Mamdani repeated his stance that Israel committed genocide in Gaza that the US funded. He also proudly reiterated: “I am a Democratic Socialist.” At the same time, Mamdani stuck or reverted to his main election issue of ‘affordability’ for New Yorkers while answering all questions. Trump, whose approval rating has slumped as inflation is again rising in the US, could do nothing but agree that the cost of living was an issue. He said he also raised and hammered home this point in his presidential election campaign.When asked if he’d cut federal funding to New York as he had threatened ahead of the mayoral election, Trump downplayed the possibility and said he’d be focusing on helping rather than hurting Mamdani to benefit the “city we both love”. Trump may have moved to Florida in recent years, but will always be seen as a New Yorker and said he’d be cheering for Mamdani and that the mayor-elect wanted to make NYC great again.Another analyst said the president likes ‘strong’ leaders as he has said publicly many times, whether referring to Pakistan’s army chief or some of those he sees as his allies across the world, including the newly elected Japanese prime minister. “He must place Mamdani in the same category, as the mayor-elect battled the whole of the Republican Party and the Democratic Party establishment to win against immense odds.”There is no doubt that many political pundits have been in awe of the army of volunteers the young politician assembled for door-to-door campaigning and the superb messaging his media team developed to target new or first-time voters on social media as well as to spread his message to the general public through his interviews and campaign ads on legacy media.Of course, the one missing element in media analyses of the apparent bonhomie in the Oval Office was the ‘transactional’ nature of the president’s policies and demeanour. He was severe, even rude, to Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, because the latter to him was someone ‘needy’.But Mamdani is not. Perhaps, the fact that Trump, his close friend and special envoy Steve Witkoff, and his son-in-law Jared Kushner (and other cronies) all have real estate interests in NYC running into several billion dollars may also have been a factor.Whether it is regulating real estate in the city including zoning, fire and safety regulations or the award of building licences, or contracts for social housing projects, the buck stops with City Hall. And the mayor more or less controls City Hall. So, Kushner, Witkoff and other family/friends-business associates, partners, and Trump himself, must have realised the importance of keeping City Hall onside, brushing aside political rhetoric and considerations.The writer is a former editor of Dawn.abbas.nasir@hotmail.comPublished in Dawn, November 23rd, 2025"
