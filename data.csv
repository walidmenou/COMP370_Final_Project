Mike Johnson kneecapped Trump's plan to compromise on health care with Dems: WSJ,"House Speaker Mike Johnson (R-LA) privately pushed President Donald Trump to stand down from his plan to offer a compromise extending Affordable Care Act subsidies for two years, the Wall Street Journal reported on Tuesday.Johnson reportedly told Trump that there weren't enough votes for such a proposal in the House. Democrats made the extension of the subsidies their critical issue in the federal government shutdown that dragged on for weeks.""The warning underscores the hurdles facing any deal in the coming weeks. Lawmakers have a mid-December deadline for healthcare votes promised as a condition for Democrats voting to end the government shutdown earlier this month. The enhanced subsidies expire at the end of the year, affecting more than 20 million people who benefit from the tax credits,"" said the report. ""On Tuesday night, Trump told reporters that he doesn’t support a two-year extension of the subsidies. 'I’d rather not extend them at all,' he said, adding that 'some kind of extension might be necessary to get something done.'""""The emerging White House plan would extend the subsidies temporarily, while imposing income caps for ACA enrollees to qualify, as well as measures to crack down on healthcare fraud, according to people familiar with the matter,"" said the report. ""Several Republicans want to pair the subsidy wind-down with the creation of health savings accounts, an approach Trump has praised.""Trump's plan was set to be revealed this week, but he punted at the last minute to give himself more time to work on it.A major sticking point has been abortion, according to the report. The ACA already prohibits federal funding from going to abortion coverage, but states and private insurers can fund that coverage separately if they wish; Republicans want to change the law so even that is illegal under any plan that receives ACA subsidies.Democrats have signaled that while they are open to income caps and anti-fraud measures, they draw a hard line against abortion restrictions — but many Republicans appear to be just as resolutely against any compromise that doesn't do so."

FBI probes congressional Democrats who warned military about illegal orders,"U.S. Senator Mark Kelly (D-AZ) looks on at a press conference on Capitol Hill in Washington, D.C., U.S., November 18, 2025. WASHINGTON--The FBI has requested interviews with six Democratic members of the U.S. Congress who in a video message told members of the military they can legally refuse to carry out unlawful orders, a Justice Department official told Reuters on Tuesday.The Pentagon on Monday threatened to recall Senator Mark Kelly, a Navy veteran and one of the six lawmakers, to active duty potentially to face military charges over what Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth described on social media as ""seditious"" acts. President Donald Trump, who critics have said has sought to harness the power of the government to try to stifle dissent, accused the six Democrats of sedition and said in a social media post that the crime is punishable by death.The Justice Department official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said the FBI interviews with the lawmakers were to determine ""if there's any wrongdoing, and then go from there."" The FBI is headed by Trump appointee Kash Patel.In a memo made public on Tuesday, Hegseth referred Kelly to the secretary of the Navy for ""potentially unlawful comments"" made in the video last week. Hegseth, in the memo, said he wanted a brief on the outcome of the review by December 10.In statements on Tuesday, the Democrats described the FBI move as an effort by the Trump administration to intimidate them into silence.""The President directing the FBI to target us is exactly why we made this video in the first place,"" U.S. Senator Elissa Slotkin of Michigan, a former CIA officer and one of the six Democrats, said on X. ""This is not the America I know, and I'm not going to let this next step from the FBI stop me from speaking up for my country, and our Constitution.""The lawmakers have said their video statements accurately reflected U.S. law. American troops swear an oath to the U.S. Constitution, not the president, and under military rules must follow ""any lawful general order or regulation.""The other Democrats who appeared in the video released last week include U.S. Representatives Jason Crow, Maggie Goodlander, Chris Deluzio and Chrissy Houlahan, all military veterans.The four House Democrats in a joint statement accused Trump of using the FBI as a tool to intimidate members of Congress and vowed that they would not be silenced. Kelly did not respond to a request for comment on Tuesday.The video did not refer to any specific illegal order, but many Democrats have expressed concerns - echoed privately by some U.S. military commanders - that the Trump administration is violating the law by ordering strikes on vessels purportedly carrying suspected drug traffickers in Latin American waters. The Pentagon has called the strikes justified because drug smugglers are considered terrorists.Democrats have also questioned the legality of Trump's use of military forces in American cities.The probe was reported earlier by Fox News.Trump's administration has shattered democratic norms by using law enforcement to pursue his perceived enemies. The Justice Department in recent months brought criminal charges against three prominent critics of the president, though a judge on Monday dismissed two of those cases.There is no charge of sedition under U.S. law for civilians, though the charge of ""seditious conspiracy"" carries a maximum penalty of 20 years. Several leaders of the January 6, 2021, attack by Trump supporters on the U.S. Capitol were convicted of that crime before Trump pardoned them.For troops, the Uniform Code of Military Justice includes a section on sedition, with possible penalties including death."

Trump backs ‘MAGA warrior’ accused of ‘misleading voters’ in military-themed ad,"President Donald Trump on Tuesday threw his “Complete and Total” support behind Republican Matt Van Epps, a Tennessee congressional candidate facing a complaint that accuses him of ""misleading voters"" by appearing in uniform in a recent campaign ad.In a post to his Truth Social platform Tuesday evening, Trump urged “all America First Patriots in Tennessee’s 7th Congressional District, who haven’t voted yet, to please GET OUT AND VOTE for MAGA Warrior Matt Van Epps” ahead of Wednesday’s final day of early in-person voting.“You can win this Election for Matt!” Trump wrote. “PLEASE VOTE FOR MATT VAN EPPS, who has my Complete and Total Endorsement.""The endorsement arrives as Van Epps, a Republican favorite who also scored the backing of Gov. Bill Lee (R-TN), faces scrutiny over a complaint filed last month involving the use of his U.S. Army uniform in one of his campaign ads. The complaint argues that Van Epps violated U.S. Department of War rules that bar military members from making political appearances in uniform or engaging in activity “that could reasonably give rise to the inference or appearance of official sponsorship, approval, or endorsement,” The Tennessean reported.Van Epps, a lieutenant colonel in the Tennessee National Guard and former Army helicopter pilot, appears in uniform throughout the ad, with patches and insignia removed, according to the Nashville-based publication. His campaign dismissed the allegations as “desperate nonsense.”But the complainant, Tennessee veteran Dillon Scott, argued that Van Epps is “improperly misleading voters about his military status” by “his flagrant flouting” of his uniform. He also called the ad “misleading and inappropriate” and “very disturbing” for someone seeking public office.The special election for the red state's Seventh Congressional District is set for Dec. 2."

Trinidad PM and senior US military official hold ‘excellent’ talks,"PORT OF SPAIN, Trinidad (CMC) – The chairman of the United States Joint Chiefs of Staff, General Dan Caine held talks on Tuesday with Trinidad Prime Minister Kamla Persad-Bissessar and members of her cabinet reaffirming the “strong partnership” between the two countries, discussing also “shared priorities for regional security and stability”.The US Embassy in Trinidad and Tobago had announced that the visit of Caine would “focus on the two nations’ strong bi-lateral relationship, strengthening regional stability, and regional unity on the vital importance of countering illicit trafficking and transnational criminal organisations”.Joint Staff spokesperson, Joseph Holstead, in a statement following the discussions said that Caine and Persad-Bissessar exchanged “views on challenges affecting the Caribbean region, including the destabilising effects of illicit narcotics, arms, and human trafficking, and transnational criminal organisation activities.”He said that the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff “emphasised that close cooperation between the United States and Trinidad and Tobago directly contributes to safeguarding regional security.“General Caine expressed appreciation for Trinidad and Tobago’s continued leadership and partnership in advancing mutual objectives and reaffirmed that the United States remains committed to working closely with Trinidad and Tobago to address shared threats and deepen collaboration across the Caribbean,” the spokesman added.In a statement posted on X, Prime Minister Persad-Bissessar described the talks as “excellent” saying that both Trinidad and Tobago and the North American country “continue to share a strong and enduring partnership”.Caine’s visit here comes as the United States President Donald Trump has ramped up its military presence in the Caribbean Sea ordering an amphibious squadron to the southern Caribbean as part of his effort to address threats from Latin American drug cartels.A nuclear-powered attack submarine, additional P8 Poseidon reconnaissance aircraft, several destroyers and a guided-missile cruiser have also been allocated to US Southern Command as part of the mission. In addition, the US largest carrier, the Gerald Forde has joined the build-upBut the United States military has been bombing vessels in the international waters claiming that the occupants were drug traffickers without offering any evidence of such activity.The United Nations UN High Commissioner for Human Rights also strongly condemned the airstrikes carried out by the United States against alleged drug trafficking boats in the Caribbean and Pacific.Volker Türk said in a statement that the strikes “violate international human rights law”, demanding that they be stopped immediately.On Tuesday, the Secretary General of the Organization of American States (OAS), Albert Ramdin, called on Venezuela and the United States not to use warfare as means of settling their differences, insisting that the hemisphere must remain a zone of peace.“I hope that both countries,Venezuela and the United States ...restrain themselves and make sure whatever other path can be found diplomatically, negotiations to solve their problems at a different level that should be..a priority.“We don’t want any war in our hemisphere. Peace in the end is what everybody in this hemisphere wants. Nobody gains from a war. So I think if we can achieve that and maintain at the same time this unity going forward on that consensus based agenda we possibly will end up after five or 10 years in a better environment...and prosperity in the Americas,” he added.Last month, the Guyana-based Caricom Secretariat said that regional leaders had discussed several issues on the regional agenda, including the security build-up in parts of the Caribbean and its potential impact on member states.It said that the position at that meeting was not endorsed by the government of Trinidad and Tobago.Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro has accused Washington of seeking a regime change in his country with its naval deployment in the Caribbean, saying “they are seeking a regime change through military threat”.He has also accused Persad-Bissessar of allowing Trinidad and Tobago to be used in carrying out the US plans."

'Sedition' Video: Trump To Send Mob To Nab US Senator? Kelly Attacks Pentagon | 'Won't Be SILENCED',"Senator Mark Kelly, a retired Navy captain, said he “will not be intimidated” after the Pentagon launched a formal misconduct review into his recent video urging U.S. service members to refuse unlawful orders. Pentagon officials confirmed they are examining whether Kelly may be recalled to active duty to face a court-martial under the Uniform Code of Military Justice. Kelly is the only one of the six Democratic lawmakers behind the video who can be legally prosecuted under military law. On MSNBC, Kelly accused President Donald Trump of calling for him to be “executed” and “hanged,” saying the president’s threats amounted to sending a mob after a sitting U.S. senator. The Pentagon, meanwhile, says Kelly’s use of his military rank created the “appearance of authority” that brought “discredit on the armed forces.” War Secretary Pete Hegseth slammed the senators’ message as “stage four TDS,” insisting Kelly’s conduct crossed a legal and ethical line.

"Game Over DOGE: US Starts Fiscal 2025 With Record Budget Deficit, Shocking Interest Expense","Game Over DOGE: US Starts Fiscal 2025 With Record Budget Deficit, Shocking Interest Expense It was back in February, when we explained to Elon Musk why his strategy to shock the US government into spending ""efficiency"" through DOGE, while noble, is ultimately doomed to wit: ""What Musk is doing in trying to streamline the govt is admirable but ultimately it will be Congress that decides the endgame. And there things are as status quo as always.""Status quo it was indeed, and it took the world's richest man several months to realize it, and while there has been a heated fight in the press whether DOGE is still technically active inside the Trump admin, we have some bad news: after a valiant start to 2025, the US has regressed to its old drunken-sailor spending ways... and has seemingly done so on steroids.Earlier today, the Treasury published the October budget data, and it was ugly. Not all of it, mind you: tax receipts were actually quite solid: at $404 billion, consisting of $217 billion in income taxes and $128 billion in social security receipts...... government revenues were actually a solid 23.7% improvement to the $326.8 billion collected in October 2024. Of course, that includes the now solid monthly contribution from Trump's tariffs which in October added $31 billion to the tally.As usual, it was government spending that was the problem again, and at $688.7 billion, or over $22 billion per day, the October total was a 17.9% jump compared to the $584.2 billion spent a year prior. And just when the US was making some modest progress on merging the red (spending) and green (revenue) lines.The combination of these two numbers resulted in a $284.4 billion deficit for the month of October, which was not only higher than the $257.5 billion deficit last October, but also higher than the record covid budget buster of $284.1 billion in October 2020! And since we are now (only) one month in fiscal 2026, we now have the worst budget-deficit start to a fiscal year in US history.In other words, no matter what the official line is, DOGE has left the building. Taking a closer look at the causes of the October budget-busting deficit reveals the same usual suspects: spending across all major categories increased in October, but the most dramatic one was once again the relentless surge in the gross US interest, which is now a record $1.24 trillion in the last twelve months, and is rapidly approaching social security ($1.589 trillion LTM) as the largest source of government spending. And here is the punchline: October gross interest was a record $104.4 billion, the highest for the month on record...... and at $1.24 trillion in LTM interest expense, it means that 24 cents of every dollar in collected taxes goes to pay interest on the debt. Bottom line: after a brief period of irrational hope in early 2025 when Musk's obsession with DOGE and cutting spending gave the US some hope that there just may some - very painful - way out of this Minsky Moment, we are not only back at square zero one and back on the fast-track to the debt-death of the United States, but the US fiscal picture has never been worse!No wonder why in a recent public commentary, Musk fully agrees with us: the government is unfixable.🚨ELON MUSK: ""I haven't been to DC since May. The government is basically unfixable. I applaud David (Sacks') noble efforts...but at the end of the day if you look at our national debt...if AI and robots don't solve our national debt, we're toast."" pic.twitter.com/XKSes4fBfq— Autism Capital 🧩 (@AutismCapital) September 10, 2025 Tyler DurdenTue, 11/25/2025 - 20:30"

Fresh clashes in Sudan as US presses for truce,"ABU DHABI: Sudan’s army said Tuesday it repelled a paramilitary assault on a key southern city, as Washington urged both sides to accept a ceasefire proposal aimed at stemming one of the world’s worst humanitarian crises.Since April 2023, the army and the paramilitary Rapid Support Forces have been locked in a brutal conflict that has killed tens of thousands of people and displaced nearly 12 million.Speaking in Abu Dhabi on Tuesday, US Africa envoy Massad Boulos said neither of Sudan’s warring parties have accepted a new truce proposal from the Quad group that includes the United States, Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates and Egypt. “We appeal to both sides to accept the humanitarian truce as presented without preconditions,” the US envoy said.His remarks came hours after RSF commander Mohamed Hamdan Daglo declared a unilateral three-month truce, before the army reported his fighters subsequently attacking a key base in the country’s south.Recent days have seen renewed diplomatic activity after US President Donald Trump said last week he would move to help end the war, following discussions with Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman during a visit to Washington.The Sudanese army on Tuesday said it repelled an RSF assault on its infantry base in the strategic West Kordofan town of Babanusa, its last major stronghold in the region.Babanusa lies on a vital transport corridor linking the capital Khartoum through the Kordofan region to Darfur, where the army last month lost El-Fasher — its last stronghold in the western region. Over two years of conflict, both sides have repeatedly violated every ceasefire agreement. Diplomatic efforts to halt the fighting have failed to make any breakthrough.A US-backed plan put forward on behalf of the Quad in September called for a three-month humanitarian truce, followed by a permanent ceasefire and a nine-month transition to civilian-led governance. The army rejected the proposal, which also hinted at excluding both the army and the RSF from Sudan’s post-war political roadmap.Burhan this week said he had dismissed a plan put forth by Boulos this month as “the worst yet”, accusing him of parroting the UAE’s talking points.Boulos on Tuesday spoke alongside UAE presidential adviser Anwar Gargash, whose country has repeatedly denied widespread reports that it arms the RSF.Boulos rejected Burhan’s accusations of bias.“He was making reference to something that does not exist, that has never been presented by us. So we have no idea what he is talking about,” the US envoy said.“We have to overlook those comments and remarks and focus on the heart of the matter which is the humanitarian crisis,” he added."

US posts USD284bn Oct budget deficit,"WASHINGTON: The US government posted a higher USD284 billion deficit for October in a report delayed and impacted by the recent federal government shutdown and which reflected record tariff revenues offset by a shift of some November benefit payments into last month’s data, the Treasury Department said on Tuesday.The budget results for the first month of the 2026 fiscal year were delayed by a 43-day shutdown of many federal agencies, which caused delays of some payments, such as for salaries of government employees, a Treasury official said.The budget results for the first month of the 2026 fiscal year were delayed by a 43-day shutdown of many federal agencies, which caused delays of some payments, such as for salaries of government employees, a Treasury official said.The deficit last month was up $27 billion, or 10%, from the $257 billion deficit posted in October 2024, largely due to the shift of some $105 billion worth of November benefit outlays for some military and healthcare programs into October.Adjusting for these shifts, the October deficit would have been about $180 billion, a 29% reduction from an adjusted October 2024 deficit of $252 billion.Outlays for October, including the November benefit payments, totaled $689 billion, up 18% from the $584 billion in October 2024. The Treasury official said the department did not have a precise estimate of how much outlays were reduced by the shutdown-delayed payments from various agencies, but that the Treasury believed the reduction was less than 5% of total outlays.Federal law requires any unpaid salaries and other obligations during government shutdowns to be fully paid when funding is restored.Receipts for October totaled $404 billion, a record for the month and a 24% increase from the $327 billion collected in October 2024.Tariff revenues hit record monthly highNet custom duties were among the biggest revenue drivers in October, reaching a new all-time monthly record of $31.4 billion because of new import tariffs imposed by President Donald Trump since he returned to the White House in January. This inflow beat the previous record of $29.7 billion in September and is more than four times the $7.3 billion recorded in October 2024.Trump said on Monday that tariff revenues would soon ""skyrocket"" to new records, arguing that businesses have largely depleted an inventory buildup of imported goods prior to his tariffs and would have to now import goods at higher rates. His comments on the Truth Social site appeared to be aimed partly at the U.S. Supreme Court, where justices earlier this month cast doubt on the legality of tariffs Trump imposed under an emergency law.""I look so much forward to the United States Supreme Court's decision on this urgent and time sensitive matter so that we can continue, in an uninterrupted manner to, MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!"" Trump wrote.Meanwhile, the Congressional Budget Office said last week that recent tariff reductions brought about by U.S. trade deals with partner economies had caused the agency to cut its estimate for how much Trump's tariffs would reduce U.S. budget deficits over the next decade by 25% to $3 trillion, including interest costs, from the $4 trillion the agency projected in August.Also driving revenues higher was the $80 billion in non-withheld tax receipts for individuals received in October, which was an increase of $35 billion, or about 75%, from October 2024. The Treasury official said this increase largely reflected payments delayed by wildfires in California, where affected residents were allowed until October 15 to file and pay taxes.Withheld individual income tax receipts rose $16 billion, or 6%, from the year-ago period to $279 billion. But October corporate tax receipts were flat at $18 billion, and the Treasury official attributed the lack of growth to corporate tax breaks contained in the Republican-passed tax-cut and spending bill enacted this year.The U.S. Treasury's interest costs hit $104 billion in October, up $22 billion, or 27%, from October 2024, reflecting a higher debt load and slightly higher weighted average interest rate of 3.36%, the Treasury official said."

""In 2021, Representative Swalwell served as an impeachment manager during President Trump’s second impeachment trial and, two months later, filed suit against President Trump for inciting the January 6 insurrection at Capitol Hill. Today, Representative Swalwell remains an ardent critic of the President, frequently denouncing the President’s actions and political agenda in national media outlets.""For this, the suit alleged, Trump and Pulte sought to seek revenge on Swalwell using the power of the state.""On November 13, 2025, Pulte formally referred Representative Swalwell to the Department of Justice for criminal prosecution on charges of mortgage fraud. In the referral, Pulte alleged that Representative Swalwell had falsely claimed his District of Columbia home as his primary residence on a mortgage agreement in order to secure more favorable loan terms,"" noted the suit.These claims are false, the suit continues — but the means with which Pulte built this allegation, snooping on his mortgage records, were a ""gross abuse of power"" that violated the 1974 Privacy Act as well as Swalwell's freedom of speech.This comes after Pulte, often referred to as Trump's ""attack dog,"" has made similar allegations against a number of other Trump critics. One such referral led to the indictment of New York Attorney General Letitia James, but a judge this week tossed that case, on the grounds that the prosecutor who briefed the grand jury was installed unlawfully."

"HUD Launches Hotline To Crack Down On Crime, Illegal Immigrants In Public Housing","HUD Launches Hotline To Crack Down On Crime, Illegal Immigrants In Public Housing Authored by Naveen Athrappully via The Epoch Times,Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) Secretary Scott Turner announced the launch of a new national hotline that allows public housing residents to report on criminals and illegal immigrants in HUD-funded housing.The hotline, 1-800-347-3735, can be used by residents to call the HUD Office of the Inspector General (OIG) for reporting “criminals, illegal aliens, sex offenders, human traffickers, and those guilty of gang activity, drug distribution, and fraud,” Turner said at a Nov. 24 press briefing in Memphis, Tennessee.Residents can also submit tips on the 24/7 monitored Hudoig.gov/hotline website.Housing Secretary Scott Turner (R) with President Donald Trump in Washington on July 22, 2025. Andrew Caballero-Reynolds/AFP via Getty ImagesAccording to Turner, law enforcement personnel stand ready to assist with any complaints received through the hotline or website. The activity is coordinated with assistance from the FBI, the Department of Justice, and state and local partners.He encouraged public housing residents to make use of the reporting platforms.“We'll clean up our public housing so that they can fulfill their function of sanctuaries for the most vulnerable people in our country, where American citizens can get a temporary hand up and then gain independence from government help,” the Housing secretary said, adding that the department wanted to assist American citizens specifically.“Illegal aliens have no place in public housing. It’s outrageous that people who should not be here come across our borders, and now usurp spots and housing units that support American people.“Establishing this hotline is an important step in fighting this injustice for both the people of Memphis and for Americans nationwide.”Turner said the hotline was part of President Donald Trump’s effort to make the city safe again, which includes the Memphis Safe Task Force. The task force was set up following a Sept. 15 directive from Trump that ordered the National Guard and government agencies to assist in restoring law and order in Memphis.More than 3,000 violent fugitives have so far been arrested by the task force since the operation began in October, Turner said. This includes more than 300 known gang members and up to 12 homicide suspects.An estimated 6.8 million Americans rely on public housing assistance, based on data from the National Center for Health in Public Housing (NCHPH).According to a September 2020 report from NCHPH, crime rates are higher in areas where Public Housing Primary Care (PHPC) Health Centers are located than the national average. These centers provide medical services to patients living in public housing or in close proximity to it.“There is an average of 505 violent crimes per 100,000 population in PHPC Health Center counties compared to the national average of 386 per 100,000,” the report reads.Mixed-Status FamiliesTrump signed an executive order in February ordering agencies to ensure that “no taxpayer-funded benefits go to unqualified aliens.”Following the executive order, Turner issued a letter to HUD grant recipients and stakeholders in April, informing them that federal housing assistance benefits will no longer be granted to illegal immigrants.“The Department will take steps to ensure that Federal resources are not used to support ‘sanctuary’ policies of State and local jurisdictions that actively prevent federal authorities from deporting illegal aliens,” the letter reads.Meanwhile, in a Sept. 15 post, policy research group Urban Institute raised concerns about how HUD’s policies would affect mixed-status families in which members have varied immigration statuses.The institute said that fewer than 1 percent of households receiving housing assistance are mixed-status and that the “HUD’s data request will have dire consequences” on this group, including psychological distress, financial hardship, and harm to children’s development.HUD said in a Nov. 21 statement that it has supported housing affordability for more than 1 million Americans this year.Since January 2025, the Federal Housing Administration, an agency under HUD, has insured mortgages for more than 700,000 homebuyers and refinance borrowers, which includes first-time homebuyers and senior citizens, it said.During this period, the Government National Mortgage Association, or Ginnie Mae, has supported more than 430,000 Veterans Affairs loans, HUD said, adding that nearly a third of these loans went to first-time homebuyers.“President Trump’s bold leadership is empowering HUD to use every tool at our disposal to make the American dream of homeownership a reality,” Turner said in a statement.

Trump displaying signs of 'fatigue' with shorter days and fewer public appearances: NYT,"Just 10 months into his second term, President Donald Trump is already exhibiting multiple signs of ""fatigue,"" according to the New York Times.The Times reported in a Tuesday article that the president's behavior has prompted various experts to question whether the administration is being forthcoming about Trump's health, given that he is the oldest person to be ever be elected president (beating out former President Joe Biden by roughly five months). George Washington University political historian Matthew Dallek told the Times that the White House is withholding information about Trump's health in ways similar to those of the Biden White House.“The people around him are similar to Biden’s aides,” Dallek said. “They would talk as if we’re living in a little bit of a fantasy world. Trump, in that way, with the help of his aides and his doctors have created this fiction about his health to hide the hard, cold truth that he is 79 and one of the oldest people to ever occupy the Oval Office.”According to the Times, Trump's ""battery shows signs of wear"" during some public appearances, including one from November in which he was seen dozing off during an Oval Office event. Trump appeared to drift in and out of sleep until someone at the event collapsed and required medical attention.Trump's public appearances themselves have also been cut short compared to his first term. The paper cited Capitol Hill outlet Roll Call's presidential calendar tracker and found that the president typically doesn't attend official events until after 12 PM, whereas his average day started around 10:30 AM during his first term.""The number of Mr. Trump’s total official appearances has decreased by 39 percent,"" the Times reported. ""In 2017, Mr. Trump held 1,688 official events between Jan. 20 and Nov. 25 of that year. For that same time period this year, Mr. Trump has appeared in 1,029 official events.""Trump's schedule is noticeably less demanding than that of his predecessors during their respective second terms. The paper found that while former President Barack Obama's days typically started around 10 AM, he maintained a regular daily schedule through 7 PM, when he had dinner with his family. Former President George W. Bush was usually in the Oval Office by 6:45 AM each day, and both Bush and Obama also made time in their schedules for regular exercise, while Trump does not.Click here to read the Times' full report (subscription required)."

Trump brags about soaring prices,"President Donald Trump is losing America, as his inability to focus on affordability is fueling his continued downward slide in the polls. As Americans clamor for relief from high prices, Trump would rather pressure Hollywood to make movies he likes. And when he does focus on affordability? Well, it’s to brag about how prices are about to go up.“Despite the massive amount of money being made by the United States of America, Hundreds of Billions of Dollars, as a direct result of Tariffs being charged to other countries, the full benefit of the Tariffs has not yet been calculated in that many of the buyers of goods and products, in order to avoid paying the Tariffs in the short term, ‘STOCK UP’ by purchasing far more inventory than they can use,” he posted on his Truth Social. “That heavy inventory purchase is now, however, wearing thin, and soon Tariffs will be paid on everything they apply to, without avoidance, and the amounts payable to the USA will SKYROCKET, over and above the already historic levels of dollars received. These payments will be RECORD SETTING, and put our Nation on a new and unprecedented course.”“Hungry hungry hypocrite” by Tim CampbellHe isn’t warning that prices will rise. He’s bragging about it, celebrating the higher costs as a sign of “record-setting” tariff revenue.That “unprecedented course” is one of even higher inflation, because when the cost of business goes up, that increase gets passed to the consumer. His post is especially revealing given Republicans’ insistence that inflationary fears around Trump’s tariffs were exaggerated because inflation softened this year. Trump is now claiming those softer numbers weren’t real—that the true economic hit was merely delayed by inventory hoarding.It’s a stunning position for a president to take. At a moment when families are desperate for relief, Trump is openly cheering on the very price hikes people are struggling with.The inflationary effect of tariffs is so unavoidable that Trump was forced to cut tariffs on 200 food products, including beef and coffee, in an effort to slow rising grocery bills after the GOP’s wipeout in this year’s off-year elections. But consumers shouldn’t expect prices to fall anytime soon. Retailers are still working through food stocks purchased under the higher tariff regime, so the recent reductions will take time to filter through. And that’s before factoring in additional cost pressures like aluminum tariffs, which raise the price of canned goods, and Trump’s mass-deportation agenda, which threatens to drive up labor costs across the agricultural sector.This is the economic reality Trump has created, yet he is still casting himself as a victim of anyone who questions his tariff authority. “We are already the ‘hottest’ Country anywhere in the World, but this Tariff POWER will bring America National Security and Wealth the likes of which has never been seen before,” he wrote, before accusing opponents of “serving hostile foreign interests.” He closed by pressuring the Supreme Court to uphold his sweeping tariff powers, calling the case “urgent and time sensitive” so he can continue to “MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!”Related |If Trump can’t do tariffs, we will lose a squidzillion dollarsThreatening the Supreme Court with accusations of disloyalty is a remarkable move from a man whose economic agenda now depends on that very court. His own policies are driving up prices, he is openly predicting more inflation, and the only institution that can limit the damage is the same one he’s trying to browbeat into submission.Trump’s economic message now boils down to demanding credit for higher prices and attacking anyone who stands in his way."

‘Significant problem’: DOJ memo clashes with Trump’s public story on cartel boat strikes,"A newly surfaced Justice Department memo is revealing a sharp break between the Trump administration’s private legal rationale for the series of deadly boat strikes in the Caribbean and the public explanation President Donald Trump has repeatedly offered. According to sources familiar with a classified Office of Legal Counsel opinion, the administration has been framing the missile strikes against drug cartels as acts of collective self-defense on behalf of U.S. allies such as Mexico and Colombia, the Guardian reported Tuesday, citing three people with direct knowledge of the internal discussions.The claim hinges on an unproven premise that drug cartels are waging armed violence against those governments using proceeds from multimillion-dollar cocaine shipments. “As a result, according to the legal analysis, the strikes are targeting the cocaine, and the deaths of anyone on board should be treated as an enemy casualty or collateral damage if any civilians are killed, rather than murder,” the exclusive report stated.But, as the Guardian noted Tuesday, the legal justification is a sweeping contrast with Trump’s stated reason for the 21 strikes that have already killed more than 80 people, which he has been portrayed by the MAGA leader as an effort to stop U.S. overdose deaths.“A White House official responded that Trump has not been making a legal argument,” the report added. “Still, Trump’s remarks remain the only public reason for why the U.S. is firing missiles – when the legal justification is in fact very different.”Critics say the new legal theory rests on shaky ground.“A significant problem with this theory is that they still have not identified any state that’s engaged in an armed conflict with a particular cartel,” law professor Martin Lederman, a former deputy assistant attorney general at the OCL during the Obama and Biden administrations, told the Guardian. “Nor has the administration provided any evidence that another state engaged in such an armed conflict has asked the U.S. to destroy cocaine shipments that are allegedly being used to subsidize armed violence against the requesting state,” he added.The Pentagon has not commented on the report. It comes as the USS Gerald R. Ford, the world’s most advanced aircraft carrier, arrived in the Caribbean."

"FBI To Interview Lawmakers In ""Illegal Orders"" Video","FBI To Interview Lawmakers In ""Illegal Orders"" Video FBI agents are seeking to interview lawmakers who appeared in a video telling members of the military not to obey illegal orders, the lawmakers said on Nov. 25.The FBI contacted the sergeants at arms for the House of Representatives and Senate, requesting interviews with the lawmakers, Reps. Jason Crow (D-Colo.), Chris Deluzio (D-Pa.), Maggie Goodlander (D-N.H.), and Chrissy Houlahan (D-Pa.) said in a joint statement.“No amount of intimidation or harassment will ever stop us from doing our jobs and honoring our Constitution,” they stated.“We swore an oath to support and defend the Constitution of the United States. That oath lasts a lifetime and we intend to keep it. We will not be bullied. We will never give up the ship.”Sen. Elissa Slotkin (D-Mich.), who also participated in the video, said on X that the FBI has “appeared to open an inquiry into” her over the video.“This isn’t just about a video. This is not the America I know, and I’m not going to let this next step from the FBI stop me from speaking up for my country and our Constitution,” she wrote.As Zachary Stieber reports for The Epoch Times, The FBI did not respond to a request for comment by publication time.In the video, released on Nov. 18, members said they wanted to speak to service members and people who work in the Intelligence Community. They said that the audience should disobey orders that are illegal. Deluzio said that “you must refuse illegal orders.”“Your vigilance is critical,” Sen. Mark Kelly (D-Ariz.) added later. “And know that we have your back,” Slotkin said.No allegedly illegal orders were specified in the video, and after posting the video, lawmakers have largely declined to list specific examples during television appearances beyond referring to how President Donald Trump has been accused of telling officials in 2020 that they should shoot protesters in the legs.“If we wait until the moment that he gives a manifestly unlawful order to a young soldier, then we have failed them,” Crow said on CBS over the weekend.“We have to start that conversation now and get people thinking about the distinction, which is exactly what we did.”Trump has accused the Democrats of seditious behavior and suggested they should be arrested and charged.Military officials announced Monday that Kelly, a retired U.S. Navy officer, is under investigation for allegedly violating the Uniform Code of Military Justice and federal law, including one law that bars actions intended to interfere with the “loyalty, morale, or discipline of the military or naval forces of the United States.”“The video made by the ‘Seditious Six’ was despicable, reckless, and false,” War Secretary Pete Hegseth said in a statement.“Encouraging our warriors to ignore the orders of their Commanders undermines every aspect of ‘good order and discipline.’ Their foolish screed sows doubt and confusion—which only puts our warriors in danger.”White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt told reporters in Washington that the White House supports the investigation.“You can’t have a functioning military if there’s disorder and chaos within the ranks—and that’s what these Democrat members were encouraging,” she said.In an interview that aired on X on Monday, FBI Director Kash Patel said career analysts and agents will make any determination on the Democratic lawmakers who urged members of the military to disobey illegal orders, when asked what his reaction to it was.""Is there a lawful predicate to open up an inquiry and investigation or is there not? And that decision will be made by the career agents and analysts here at the FBI,"" Patel said in the interview.When asked if the FBI was involved, Patel said, ""based on the fact that it's an ongoing matter, there's not much I can say.""

Takaichi said the conversation, requested by Trump, focused on strengthening the Japan–US alliance and the wider Indo‐Pacific situation, and she highlighted Trump’s description of her as a “close friend,” signaling tight Washington–Tokyo coordination that is likely to further irritate Beijing.

'Unthinkable': Ukrainian MP bashes Trump for 'making concessions to appease the aggressor',"A Ukrainian lawmaker bashed President Donald Trump's proposal to end the country's four-year war with Russia during a new interview on Tuesday. The Trump administration recently laid out a 28-point peace plan for Russia's war in Ukraine, a plan that some experts say appears to have been written by Russian authorities. The initial plan included language requiring Ukraine to cede land to Russia and significantly reduce the size of its army. Even though the plan has undergone significant revisions since then, it will still be a ""major issue"" for the Ukrainian people to deal with, according to Ukrainian MP Lesia Vasylenko.Vasylenko discussed the peace plan in a new interview with Times Radio. ""For the Ukrainian people, this will be a major issue to deal with for us as the country that has fallen victim to Russia's aggression,"" she said. ""It's absolutely unthinkable that we should be making concessions to appease the aggressor.""Part of the 28-point peace plan called on Ukraine to draw down its long-range missiles that can reach Moscow. Some experts have speculated that the move would allow Russia more time to regroup and restart the war at a later date. ""Such tactics have never worked in history,"" Vasylenko said. ""And it would be awful to see history repeat itself when we're appeasing the aggressor, buying time for the aggressor to regroup, rearm, and to wage another war, a war which will be all-encompassing, possibly going beyond the borders of Ukraine to our Eastern European neighbors to our Baltic neighbors, and dragging in the whole of the European continent. This is a very expensive solution."""

"Trump will meet with Zelensky, Putin only in final stages of peace deal","President Trump said on Tuesday that he will only meet Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky and Russian President Vladimir Putin when the parties get closer to an agreement on ending the war. Why it matters: Trump initially set Thanksgiving as the deadline for getting Ukraine to sign on to his peace plan, but as the negotiations caught steam, he seems open to allowing more time for talks. Trump told reporters Tuesday evening aboard Air Force One en route to Florida that he doesn't have a firm deadline for reaching a deal.Driving the news: ""Over the past week, my team has made tremendous progress with respect to ending the War between Russia and Ukraine. The original 28-Point Peace Plan, which was drafted by the United States, has been fine-tuned, with additional input from both sides, and there are only a few remaining points of disagreement,"" Trump wrote on Truth Social. Next, White House Envoy Steve Witkoff will meet with Putin in Moscow. Trump told reporters on Air Force One the meeting will take place next week. Secretary of the Army Dan Driscoll — who held talks with Russian officials in Abu Dhabi on Tuesday — will hold another meeting with the Ukrainians. ""I look forward to hopefully meeting with President Zelenskyy and President Putin soon, but ONLY when the deal to end this War is FINAL or, in its final stages,"" Trump wrote.State of play: After successful negotiations with the U.S. in Geneva on Sunday, Zelensky pushed to get a meeting with Trump in Mar-a-Lago this week, possibly during Thanksgiving. But the White House was hesitant to extend the invitation before it sees the Russian reaction to an amended 19-point peace plan.What they're saying: Zelensky's chief of staff Andryi Yermak wrote on X that he spoke to Driscoll on Tuesday and said the Army Secretary will be in Kyiv again later this week. ""We are ready to continue working as swiftly as possible to finalize the steps necessary to end the bloodshed,"" Yermak wrote.""We have a solid foundation laid in Geneva, and President Zelensky, along with the entire team in Kyiv, are fully committed to further cooperation. The meeting of the Presidents will be thoroughly and promptly prepared on our side.""Editor's note: This article has been updated with additional details throughout."
