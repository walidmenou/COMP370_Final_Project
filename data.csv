'Can't make this up': Mark Kelly says Trump administration prosecuting him is ridiculous​,"Arizona senator Mark Kelly has ridiculed comments made by Donald Trump, who called his recent actions ""seditious"" in a furious Truth Social post.The president had also implied Democrats calling on military personnel to reject illegal orders be ""executed"", with Kelly addressing the comments on Jimmy Kimmel Live. Secretary of War Pete Hegseth confirmed an investigation was now underway into Kelly over ""potentially unlawful comments"", The Guardian reported.In response to Trump's ""seditious behaviour"" comment, Kelly suggested the president is using the FBI against him and a select group of Senators who called on the military to oppose illegal orders as a ""tool to intimidate and harass members of Congress"".Kelly went further in his comments during an appearance on Jimmy Kimmel's talk show, where he called the comment made by Trump ""ridiculous"".Kimmel asked Kelly ""what even is sedition?"", to which the Arizona senator replied, ""Well this is the investigation, because of what Donald Trump said. From what I can tell, and I don't know Pete Hegseth well, I sit on the committee that ultimately had to confirm him, so I know a little bit about his background. He's totally unqualified.""From what I can tell, talking to some of my Republican colleagues, I mean he just wants to please the president. This is what he can do this week, he can go after me under the uniform code of military justice, which is a law in the military, which is kind of wild because we recited something in the uniform code of military justice and he's going to prosecute me under the uniform code of military justice.""Kelly would go on to call Hegseth's decision to prosecute him ""so ridiculous"", adding, ""It's almost like you can't make this s**t up."" It comes as a former Bush administration official calls the Trump administration on its bluff to prosecute Kelly.Kelly had participated in a video published last week in which several Democratic lawmakers urged active duty service members to defy unlawful orders, a video that sparked outrage from President Donald Trump, who went on to accuse the lawmakers of “seditious behavior” and threatened to execute them.On Monday, the Pentagon announced that it was investigating Kelly – a former Navy pilot – for his participation in the video, but on Tuesday, Cully Stimson – also a former Navy pilot – poured cold water on the prosecution’s chances at success.Stimson said, ""I don't think any military jury is ever going to convict this guy, ever. So I think the punishment here is the process, and they'll ultimately not prosecute him or bring him back on active duty.""",https://www.rawstory.com/mark-kelly-2674343165/

'Right before Thanksgiving': Trump sparks social media backlash over ACA subsidy remarks,"President Donald Trump set off a new firestorm over the future of the Affordable Care Act, saying he prefers giving ACA funds “directly to the people” instead of extending subsidies to insurance companies. The comments came Tuesday night as Trump spoke to reporters on Air Force One en route to Florida, when the president suggested he might even prefer letting the subsidies expire entirely.“I’d rather not,” he responded when asked whether he planned on extending ACA subsidies. “Somebody said, ‘I want to extend them for two years,’ I don’t want to extend them for two years. I’d rather not extend them at all.”“I like my plan the best,” he added.Reactions on social media were swift and often critical.Rep.

Moore wrote on Bluesky.“If Dems send Mamdani back in to talk with Trump, Trump will be agreeing to permanent ACA subsidies before they even sit down,” Bluesky user @androo wrote Tuesday.Timothy McBride, a professor at Washington University in St. Louis, summed up Trump’s new posturing with a single word on Bluesky: “Whiplash..”The MAGA leader’s comments come as an estimated 22 million Americans face potential premium hikes starting in January, according to NBC News.Got it ... right before Thanksgiving ... health care for 20M Americans isn’t your priority ... on your way to your resort ... https://t.co/syi7ETRoJU— U.S. Rep.

Trump admin hikes national parks prices by up to $170 for international tourists,"The Trump administration is raising national parks' prices and adding fees for international tourists from next year in an ""America-first"" initiative that'll see U.S. residents ""continue to enjoy affordable pricing,"" the Interior Department announced Tuesday.The big picture: The new fees that take effect from Jan. 1 follow a tumultuous year for the National Park Service after hundreds of workers were fired in the Trump administration's purge of federal employees, and Axios' Emily Peck reports international air travel has declined amid travelers saying they're put off by tariffs.Driving the news: Under the ""America-first"" entry fee policies, ""nonresidents will pay a higher rate to help support the care and maintenance of America's parks,"" said the Interior Department, which manages federal land, in a statement Tuesday.It will also hold ""resident-only patriotic fee-free days"" on the 110th birthday of the National Park Service and on holidays in 2026 including Flag Day, which the statement notes is President Trump's birthday.By the numbers: While the cost of an annual parks pass for U.S. residents will remain at $80, international travelers will from Jan. 1 have to pay $250 — an increase of $170.Non-residents without an annual pass will from that date have to pay a $100 per person fee in addition to the standard entrance fee to visit each of the 11 most popular national parks, including the Grand Canyon, Yosemite and Yellowstone.Zoom in: ""Under the new system, the America the Beautiful passes — including Annual, Military, Senior, 4th Grade and Access — will be available in a fully digital format through Recreation.gov,"" per the statement.""In addition, the National Park Service is expanding affordability and access for motorcycle riders. All America the Beautiful passes will now cover two motorcycles per pass.""What they're saying: Interior Secretary Doug Burgum said in a video posted to X the price hike for international travelers ""ensures they contribute their fair share to help preserve and maintain these treasured places.""Go deeper: Why foreign travelers are avoiding the U.S.",https://www.axios.com/2025/11/26/national-park-prices-tourists-trump-america-first

Recap: Trump drops deadline 4 Ukraine peace deal as U.S. seeks rapid agreement with Russia,"President Donald Trump has walked back his earlier insistence that Ukraine agree to a U.S.-backed peace plan by Thanksgiving, saying there is no firm deadline for a deal and that “the deadline for me is when it’s over.”Speaking to reporters aboard Air Force One en route to Florida for the Thanksgiving break, Trump said U.S. negotiators were making headway in talks with both Kyiv and Moscow, and that Russia had agreed to certain concessions — though he declined to specify what they were.The emerging U.S. framework for ending the conflict, reported last week, has raised concern that Washington may be pressuring Ukraine into terms that favour Moscow. Trump confirmed that his envoy, Steve Witkoff, will travel to Moscow soon to meet President Vladimir Putin. He also said Jared Kushner, who helped broker the Gaza ceasefire, is involved in the negotiations.Trump had previously floated Thursday as the date he wanted an agreement in place, but both he and senior officials have since softened the stance, saying they simply aim for a deal “as soon as possible.”The president also suggested Russia currently holds a battlefield advantage and warned that Ukraine risks losing additional territory in the coming months. He said talks were underway with European partners on potential security guarantees for Kyiv as part of any settlement.

WSJ slams Trump for pardoning man who illegally voted for him twice,"When President Donald Trump issued pardons to numerous Republican Party officials, lawyers and activists who tried to help him overturn the results of the 2020 presidential election, he also may have inadvertently included one man who committed voter fraud on his behalf. Now, the Wall Street Journal (WSJ) editorial board is questioning the implications of that defendant's accepting of the pardon.On Tuesday, the paper said Trump's pardons suggest he has ""thrown legal caution to the wind,"" and warned him that those winds ""can blow in unexpected directions."" The WSJ compared Trump to former President Joe Biden in labeling his his pardons as ""capacious and unconditional.""The conservative editorial board noted that Trump had ""no power"" to dismiss most of those cases, which are being handled by various state officials, making the pardons ""symbolic."" And while the pardons were largely for members of his legal team like former New York City Mayor Rudi Giuliani and attorneys like John Eastman and Sidney Powell, one of the people who indirectly received a pardon in an ongoing federal case is Matthew Laiss.As Votebeat reported, Laiss moved from Pennsylvania to Florida in August of 2020 and cast ballots for Trump in both states, voting in-person in Florida and casting a mail-in ballot in Bucks County, Pennsylvania. Laiss' attorney has argued that because Trump's clemency announcement grants ""a full, complete, and unconditional pardon to all United States citizens"" for 2020 election misconduct, Laiss qualifies for the pardon.""By its plain language, the pardon extends to Mr. Laiss,"" the man's attorney wrote in a court filing.

Trump backs ‘MAGA warrior’ accused of ‘misleading voters’ in military-themed ad,"President Donald Trump on Tuesday threw his “Complete and Total” support behind Republican Matt Van Epps, a Tennessee congressional candidate facing a complaint that accuses him of ""misleading voters"" by appearing in uniform in a recent campaign ad.In a post to his Truth Social platform Tuesday evening, Trump urged “all America First Patriots in Tennessee’s 7th Congressional District, who haven’t voted yet, to please GET OUT AND VOTE for MAGA Warrior Matt Van Epps” ahead of Wednesday’s final day of early in-person voting.“You can win this Election for Matt!” Trump wrote. “PLEASE VOTE FOR MATT VAN EPPS, who has my Complete and Total Endorsement.""The endorsement arrives as Van Epps, a Republican favorite who also scored the backing of Gov. Bill Lee (R-TN), faces scrutiny over a complaint filed last month involving the use of his U.S. Army uniform in one of his campaign ads. The complaint argues that Van Epps violated U.S. Department of War rules that bar military members from making political appearances in uniform or engaging in activity “that could reasonably give rise to the inference or appearance of official sponsorship, approval, or endorsement,” The Tennessean reported.Van Epps, a lieutenant colonel in the Tennessee National Guard and former Army helicopter pilot, appears in uniform throughout the ad, with patches and insignia removed, according to the Nashville-based publication. His campaign dismissed the allegations as “desperate nonsense.”But the complainant, Tennessee veteran Dillon Scott, argued that Van Epps is “improperly misleading voters about his military status” by “his flagrant flouting” of his uniform. He also called the ad “misleading and inappropriate” and “very disturbing” for someone seeking public office.The special election for the red state's Seventh Congressional District is set for Dec. 2.",https://www.rawstory.com/trump-endorsement-2674342740/

Trump displaying signs of 'fatigue' with shorter days and fewer public appearances: NYT,"Just 10 months into his second term, President Donald Trump is already exhibiting multiple signs of ""fatigue,"" according to the New York Times.The Times reported in a Tuesday article that the president's behavior has prompted various experts to question whether the administration is being forthcoming about Trump's health, given that he is the oldest person to be ever be elected president (beating out former President Joe Biden by roughly five months). George Washington University political historian Matthew Dallek told the Times that the White House is withholding information about Trump's health in ways similar to those of the Biden White House.“The people around him are similar to Biden’s aides,” Dallek said. “They would talk as if we’re living in a little bit of a fantasy world. Trump, in that way, with the help of his aides and his doctors have created this fiction about his health to hide the hard, cold truth that he is 79 and one of the oldest people to ever occupy the Oval Office.”According to the Times, Trump's ""battery shows signs of wear"" during some public appearances, including one from November in which he was seen dozing off during an Oval Office event. Trump appeared to drift in and out of sleep until someone at the event collapsed and required medical attention.Trump's public appearances themselves have also been cut short compared to his first term. The paper cited Capitol Hill outlet Roll Call's presidential calendar tracker and found that the president typically doesn't attend official events until after 12 PM, whereas his average day started around 10:30 AM during his first term.""The number of Mr. Trump’s total official appearances has decreased by 39 percent,"" the Times reported. ""In 2017, Mr. Trump held 1,688 official events between Jan. 20 and Nov. 25 of that year. For that same time period this year, Mr. Trump has appeared in 1,029 official events.""Trump's schedule is noticeably less demanding than that of his predecessors during their respective second terms. The paper found that while former President Barack Obama's days typically started around 10 AM, he maintained a regular daily schedule through 7 PM, when he had dinner with his family. Former President George W. Bush was usually in the Oval Office by 6:45 AM each day, and both Bush and Obama also made time in their schedules for regular exercise, while Trump does not.Click here to read the Times' full report (subscription required).",https://www.rawstory.com/alternet-posts/trump-fatigue-nyt/
Trump brags about soaring prices,"President Donald Trump is losing America, as his inability to focus on affordability is fueling his continued downward slide in the polls. As Americans clamor for relief from high prices, Trump would rather pressure Hollywood to make movies he likes. And when he does focus on affordability? Well, it’s to brag about how prices are about to go up.“Despite the massive amount of money being made by the United States of America, Hundreds of Billions of Dollars, as a direct result of Tariffs being charged to other countries, the full benefit of the Tariffs has not yet been calculated in that many of the buyers of goods and products, in order to avoid paying the Tariffs in the short term, ‘STOCK UP’ by purchasing far more inventory than they can use,” he posted on his Truth Social. “That heavy inventory purchase is now, however, wearing thin, and soon Tariffs will be paid on everything they apply to, without avoidance, and the amounts payable to the USA will SKYROCKET, over and above the already historic levels of dollars received. These payments will be RECORD SETTING, and put our Nation on a new and unprecedented course.”“Hungry hungry hypocrite” by Tim CampbellHe isn’t warning that prices will rise. He’s bragging about it, celebrating the higher costs as a sign of “record-setting” tariff revenue.That “unprecedented course” is one of even higher inflation, because when the cost of business goes up, that increase gets passed to the consumer. His post is especially revealing given Republicans’ insistence that inflationary fears around Trump’s tariffs were exaggerated because inflation softened this year. Trump is now claiming those softer numbers weren’t real—that the true economic hit was merely delayed by inventory hoarding.It’s a stunning position for a president to take. At a moment when families are desperate for relief, Trump is openly cheering on the very price hikes people are struggling with.The inflationary effect of tariffs is so unavoidable that Trump was forced to cut tariffs on 200 food products, including beef and coffee, in an effort to slow rising grocery bills after the GOP’s wipeout in this year’s off-year elections. But consumers shouldn’t expect prices to fall anytime soon. Retailers are still working through food stocks purchased under the higher tariff regime, so the recent reductions will take time to filter through. And that’s before factoring in additional cost pressures like aluminum tariffs, which raise the price of canned goods, and Trump’s mass-deportation agenda, which threatens to drive up labor costs across the agricultural sector.This is the economic reality Trump has created, yet he is still casting himself as a victim of anyone who questions his tariff authority. “We are already the ‘hottest’ Country anywhere in the World, but this Tariff POWER will bring America National Security and Wealth the likes of which has never been seen before,” he wrote, before accusing opponents of “serving hostile foreign interests.” He closed by pressuring the Supreme Court to uphold his sweeping tariff powers, calling the case “urgent and time sensitive” so he can continue to “MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!”Related |If Trump can’t do tariffs, we will lose a squidzillion dollarsThreatening the Supreme Court with accusations of disloyalty is a remarkable move from a man whose economic agenda now depends on that very court. His own policies are driving up prices, he is openly predicting more inflation, and the only institution that can limit the damage is the same one he’s trying to browbeat into submission.Trump’s economic message now boils down to demanding credit for higher prices and attacking anyone who stands in his way.",https://www.dailykos.com/story/2025/11/25/2355529/-Trump-brags-about-soaring-prices

'Unthinkable': Ukrainian MP bashes Trump for 'making concessions to appease the aggressor',"A Ukrainian lawmaker bashed President Donald Trump's proposal to end the country's four-year war with Russia during a new interview on Tuesday. The Trump administration recently laid out a 28-point peace plan for Russia's war in Ukraine, a plan that some experts say appears to have been written by Russian authorities. The initial plan included language requiring Ukraine to cede land to Russia and significantly reduce the size of its army. Even though the plan has undergone significant revisions since then, it will still be a ""major issue"" for the Ukrainian people to deal with, according to Ukrainian MP Lesia Vasylenko.Vasylenko discussed the peace plan in a new interview with Times Radio. ""For the Ukrainian people, this will be a major issue to deal with for us as the country that has fallen victim to Russia's aggression,"" she said. ""It's absolutely unthinkable that we should be making concessions to appease the aggressor.""Part of the 28-point peace plan called on Ukraine to draw down its long-range missiles that can reach Moscow. Some experts have speculated that the move would allow Russia more time to regroup and restart the war at a later date. ""Such tactics have never worked in history,"" Vasylenko said. ""And it would be awful to see history repeat itself when we're appeasing the aggressor, buying time for the aggressor to regroup, rearm, and to wage another war, a war which will be all-encompassing, possibly going beyond the borders of Ukraine to our Eastern European neighbors to our Baltic neighbors, and dragging in the whole of the European continent.

"Trump will meet with Zelensky, Putin only in final stages of peace deal","President Trump said on Tuesday that he will only meet Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky and Russian President Vladimir Putin when the parties get closer to an agreement on ending the war. Why it matters: Trump initially set Thanksgiving as the deadline for getting Ukraine to sign on to his peace plan, but as the negotiations caught steam, he seems open to allowing more time for talks. Trump told reporters Tuesday evening aboard Air Force One en route to Florida that he doesn't have a firm deadline for reaching a deal.Driving the news: ""Over the past week, my team has made tremendous progress with respect to ending the War between Russia and Ukraine. The original 28-Point Peace Plan, which was drafted by the United States, has been fine-tuned, with additional input from both sides, and there are only a few remaining points of disagreement,"" Trump wrote on Truth Social. Next, White House Envoy Steve Witkoff will meet with Putin in Moscow. Trump told reporters on Air Force One the meeting will take place next week. Secretary of the Army Dan Driscoll — who held talks with Russian officials in Abu Dhabi on Tuesday — will hold another meeting with the Ukrainians. ""I look forward to hopefully meeting with President Zelenskyy and President Putin soon, but ONLY when the deal to end this War is FINAL or, in its final stages,"" Trump wrote.State of play: After successful negotiations with the U.S. in Geneva on Sunday, Zelensky pushed to get a meeting with Trump in Mar-a-Lago this week, possibly during Thanksgiving. But the White House was hesitant to extend the invitation before it sees the Russian reaction to an amended 19-point peace plan.What they're saying: Zelensky's chief of staff Andryi Yermak wrote on X that he spoke to Driscoll on Tuesday and said the Army Secretary will be in Kyiv again later this week. ""We are ready to continue working as swiftly as possible to finalize the steps necessary to end the bloodshed,"" Yermak wrote.""We have a solid foundation laid in Geneva, and President Zelensky, along with the entire team in Kyiv, are fully committed to further cooperation. The meeting of the Presidents will be thoroughly and promptly prepared on our side.""Editor's note: This article has been updated with additional details throughout.",https://www.axios.com/2025/11/25/trump-putin-zelensky-peace-ukraine-russia

'It's just embarrassing': Analyst stunned as Trump undercuts JD Vance on global stage,"Vice President JD Vance appears to be aggressively positioning himself as the heir apparent to the MAGA movement by taking an isolationist stance on Russia's war in Ukraine, a move that President Donald Trump keeps undermining, according to one analyst. The vice president has publicly lauded Trump's actions to end the war in Ukraine, going so far as to say Trump deserves a Nobel Peace Prize. He has also sharply criticized members of his own party for not supporting the contentious 28-point peace plan that has been proposed to the Ukrainians, arguing in a recent post on X that the ""beltway GOP"" would prefer to see the four-year war between Russia and Ukraine continue rather than address any of the issues Trump faces at home. However, Trump continues to undercut Vance by spending time and political capital on international issues like the war in Ukraine, as well as other affairs. For instance, Trump dispatched army secretary Dan Driscoll, whom he's referred to as ""the drone guy,'"" to Ukraine to learn how America can modernize its military drone system. Journalist Michael Weiss discussed this dynamic on a new episode of ""The Bulwark Podcast"" with host Tim Miller. ""It's just embarrassing,"" Weiss said. ""This is the other kind of subtext of this thing. JD Vance's guy is there to tell Ukrainians, here are the terms of your surrender, and oh, by the way, teach us how to fight a war because we suck.""",https://www.rawstory.com/it-s-just-embarassing-analyst-stunned-as-trump-undercuts-jd-vance-on-world-s-stage/

Proposed ESA Changes Would Restore Key Trump 1.0 Regulations,"The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (FWS) and the National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS) (collectively, the Services) proposed four rules that would modify key Endangered Species Act (ESA) regulations. Two of the proposed rules were issued jointly by the Services, and two were issued solely by FWS. Together, these proposed changes would restore regulatory changes promulgated under the first Trump administration in 2019 and 2020 that largely were rescinded by the Biden administration in 2022 and 2024, while adding clarifications intended to improve transparency and align regulatory standards more closely with longstanding agency practice.The proposals would affect several foundational ESA processes, including listing and delisting determinations, critical habitat designations and exclusions, threatened species protections, and interagency consultation requirements.

Nicolle Wallace shuts down key Trump claim about the economy,"President Donald Trump's administration has continued to maintain that the economy during Trump's second term has been strong, even as prices for basic necessities continue to climb.During a Tuesday segment, MS NOW host Nicolle Wallace contrasted the words of Trump administration figures like Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent with comments from ordinary Americans experiencing sticker shock at grocery stores. At the start of the segment, two separate Yonkers, New York residents — Lindsay Gottfried and Harryson Berrios — told MS NOW that ""generally everything has gone up.""""I think generally everything has gone up,"" Gottfried said. ""... Milk really seems to fluctuate a lot.""""Just trying to stay up from inflation, working hard and making sure that the family has a good time,"" Berrios said when asked about his grocery shopping experience. ""In a monthly basis, it has gotten to $1,000 a month for food, and trying to recover from everything that goes on.""Wallace then pivoted to a clip from NBC's Kristen Welker on Sunday's episode of ""Meet the Press"" telling Bessent that ""inflation has gone up,"" adding that it was a full percentage point higher than when Trump first imposed his broad tariffs in April.""So inflation hasn't gone up,"" Bessent responded. ""And Kristen, the one thing that we're not going to do is do what the Biden administration did and tell the American people they don't know how they feel.""""That sound bite is next to gaslighting in the dictionary right now,"" Wallace said after playing the clip of Bessent's remarks. ""And you know what? You can kill all the data you want. People that go to the grocery store, people that shop for clothes, people that shop for goods, people that buy strollers, people that buy car seats, people that buy walkers, they know everything is more expensive.""Wallace additionally pointed out that the Trump administration has continued to lose the confidence of the American public in its handling of the economy. A Fox News poll conducted earlier this month found that Trump's disapproval rating had hit a record high of 58 percent, with broad majorities of Americans saying basic needs had gotten more expensive under his administration including groceries, utilities, healthcare and housing.Watch the segment below: - YouTube www.youtube.com",https://www.rawstory.com/alternet-posts/nicolle-wallace-trump-economy/
Trump targets Dems who spoke out because ‘they are everything he is not’: analyst,"Former Naval War College professor Tom Nichols delivered a blistering assessment of President Donald in an interview Tuesday, arguing that the president's latest attacks on Democratic lawmakers who urged service members to defy illegal orders have nothing to do with national security – and everything to do with Trump’s character.Nichols said Tuesday on MS NOW that Trump is “intimidated by anyone who exhibits any kind of virtue, any kind of commitment to selfless service, any kind of loyalty to something bigger than themselves.” He went on to tell “Deadline: White House” host Nicolle Wallace that Trump, “as a narcissist,” is psychologically incapable of understanding why people act from principle rather than personal gain.“It just doesn't compute for him,” he added. “He literally can't parse the thought that people do things for, as a matter of principle, as service to others, as self-sacrifice,” Nichols said, recalling Trump’s infamous visit to Arlington National Cemetery, where he allegedly asked, “What was in it for them?” “And I think places like Arlington Cemetery and people like Mark Kelly or John Kelly or Jim Mattis or others, they make him uncomfortable because they're a constant reminder of everything he is not,” the Atlantic writer and former professor said.The stinging analysis comes after several Democratic lawmakers, including Sen. Mark Kelly (D-AZ), urged active duty service members to defy unlawful orders in a video that sparked outrage from the president, who went on to accuse the lawmakers of “seditious behavior” and threatened to execute them.",https://www.rawstory.com/trump-military-2674342320/

We’ve been told this is the one program they actually support,” Delany said. “We work very hard to differentiate ourselves from H-1B and some of these other visa programs,” he said, explaining that the group is aiming to present the visas as what the resort members need and a ""workforce visa program"" and not as an ""immigration program.""",https://www.rawstory.com/donald-trump-2674342209/

Identity verification processes broke down during Trump govt transition: report,"Individuals who gained improper access during the 2024–25 presidential transition could continue to hold credentials or have access inside the federal government.That is the glaring unanswered question that emerges from the Lessons Learned report on the Biden administration’s handoff to the second Trump administration.The report is explicit that identity verification broke down and that agencies could not trust incoming requests. It also states that the Trump team declined .gov infrastructure, causing security risks and forcing agencies into improvised communication channels.The report is a product of the Center for Presidential Transition, and it confirms that unauthorized individuals sought access during the transition, that agencies struggled to verify identities, that the Trump team rejected government-secured IT systems, and that routine background checks and credentialing steps were delayed or bypassed.However, the report offers no indication that these vulnerabilities were ever corrected, or that those who may have slipped through during the transition were removed from federal systems after Inauguration Day.The Center for Presidential Transition assists presidential candidates, the incumbent administration, and agencies with transition planning.The center’s report begins by noting that the 2024 transition “was characterized by significant departures from established norms and set a precedent for future transitions to stray from processes that ensure transparency, ethics and security.”It added that “the new administration’s willingness to deviate from existing norms has continued to characterize its approach to governing throughout its first year.”The Trump transition “team created security concerns” from the outset, the report says, noting that “the Trump team conducted its work in the Willard Hotel in downtown Washington, D.C., in New York City, at Mar-a-Lago and virtually.”Those departures were not abstract concerns, either. They created specific, trackable failures in how the federal government authenticates personnel, controls identity, and secures the flow of sensitive information at the moment when the government is least able to absorb risk.The Trump team’s decision to reject standard government IT systems immediately destabilized the basic infrastructure used to verify who was who.Because the transition declined a government-secured email domain, “agency officials had to negotiate how to securely exchange information” with transition personnel, since the team “did not use a government-provided server or .gov email addresses.”Transition members contacted agencies using a patchwork of private domains - “@transition47.com, @trumpvancetransition.com and @djtfp24.com” - and as the report bluntly notes, “not all requests were from legitimate sources.”That single sentence should alarm anyone familiar with federal cybersecurity protocols, as it meant federal agencies could not rely on verified domains to authenticate identity. They could not be certain that the person emailing them was a legitimate transition member.Further, because the communications occurred on private servers outside government control, federal agencies lack the authoritative logs normally used to reconstruct who asked for access, who was granted access, and who handled what information.As the report states, “It was unclear if the domain platforms met government security requirements ... and there were also concerns about an external server’s vulnerability to cyberthreats.”Consequently, “the lack of standard infrastructure created a risk of inadvertently sharing sensitive information with unauthorized parties or sending it through unsecured channels that might be hacked,” the report concluded.The authentication instability this created was not hypothetical. Federal agencies reported that “some agencies reported individuals not on these lists arriving at agencies or contacting employees directly to ask for physical or electronic access,” again noting that not all were legitimate.A second, equally troubling thread running through the report is the emergence of individuals identifying themselves as part of the so-called “Department of Government Efficiency,” or DOGE, an entity that did not formally exist within the authorized transition structure.The report confirms that during the compressed, disorganized transition window, “some agencies reported individuals not on these lists arriving at agencies or contacting employees directly to ask for physical or electronic access,” and several of these individuals “identified themselves as the ‘Department of Government Efficiency,’ or DOGE, team.”The appearance of DOGE operatives is not merely an anecdote about confusion. It is a direct illustration of how the breakdown in identity verification created an opening for unauthorized players to position themselves inside federal systems.With the transition rejecting government-secured email and relying on private domains, agencies had no consistent authentication mechanism. The report makes clear that under these conditions “not all requests were from legitimate sources,” a line that underscores how easily DOGE actors could exploit the vacuum left by the absence of authoritative rosters and secure communication channels.DOGE’s activities highlight the systemic nature of the vulnerabilities.When agencies “struggled to verify digital communications from individuals claiming to be transition personnel,” and when the team declined government-secured servers in favor of private infrastructure whose security “was unclear,” the federal government temporarily lost the ability to distinguish legitimate transition representatives from illegitimate actors.In a transition environment where background checks were delayed, email identities could not be verified, and access lists were incomplete, DOGE did not need sophisticated tradecraft to insert itself.The report never clarifies whether DOGE-affiliated individuals gained access, what information they received, or whether their attempts were ultimately blocked. Just as critically, it does not say whether any DOGE-linked identities, credentials, or access pathways were reviewed or revoked after inauguration.In that silence, the DOGE episode becomes a case study in how an authentication vacuum created by rejecting .gov infrastructure and delaying security agreements can enable unauthorized actors to appear inside the machinery of federal power.In September, the Senate Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs issued a report that warned of DOGE’s sweeping violations of privacy safeguards.Because the Trump transition delayed signing agreements with the White House and Department of Justice, agency review teams did not begin entering agencies until mid-December, causing the team to forgo “roughly six weeks of collaboration” and leaving a vacuum into which unverifiable actors began to insert themselves.The most critical vetting mechanism – background checks by the Federal Bureau of Investigation - were also stalled. The transition did not sign its Department of Justice Memorandum of Understanding until December 4, “preventing the FBI from processing background checks for future appointees or transition team members.”Without these checks, “transition team members could not receive classified transition briefings,” the report documented.While that restriction applied to classified communications, nothing in the report suggests that the same level of caution applied to unclassified but sensitive information, which government agencies often must share quickly during a transition.But perhaps the most glaring, and ominous, element of the report is what it does not say. Nowhere does it explain whether the government conducted a post-inaugural audit to identify everyone who gained access during the transition.Nowhere does it say whether unauthorized individuals were flagged and removed.And nowhere does it state whether credentials granted during the chaotic transition - particularly under improvised or unverifiable email identities - were deactivated on January 20 – the day of Trump’s inauguration - or reviewed later for irregularities.Instead, the report offers silence.This omission is striking because the document acknowledges the seriousness of the vulnerabilities. It warns that “the lack of standard infrastructure created a risk of inadvertently sharing sensitive information with unauthorized parties or sending it through unsecured channels that might be hacked.”It acknowledges that agencies “struggled to verify digital communications from individuals claiming to be transition personnel.”It states plainly that both the use of private servers and the delays in background checks “created national security risks.”Yet, after inaugurating the new administration, the report does not indicate that these national security risks were evaluated, corrected, or even systematically investigated.The identity governance gaps extended into the early days of the administration. After the inauguration, the report notes that rapid, unpredictable reassignments of career officials “led to confusion and chaos as officials found themselves in roles that they had neither expected nor prepared for.”Sudden changes in acting officials, chains of authority, and personnel roles create additional instability in access permissions, auditing, and account disposition. When early-term governance is chaotic, access control cleanup rarely occurs with rigor.The transparency and disclosure mechanisms designed to ensure accountability were also bypassed. Because the Trump team refused the services of the General Services Administration, it “was not legally obligated to make the donor, funding, and agency review team disclosures directed in the transition law.”Without these disclosures, the public - and federal agencies - “lost a valuable understanding of the individuals and organizations influencing the administration,” and without that visibility “there are fewer eyes ensuring ethical governance.”Without authoritative personnel lists, agency systems have no reliable baseline against which to compare access requests or credentials.This is the connective tissue of the unanswered question. If the government does not know definitively who was involved in the transition, it also cannot know definitively who might have retained access afterward.None of this means unauthorized access persisted into the Trump administration, but the report shows that the systems which were designed to prevent it were weakened, delayed, bypassed, or replaced with private infrastructure outside federal oversight.The absence of a corrective review inside the report strongly suggests that any cleanup - if it happened at all - was informal, piecemeal, and based on agency-level triage rather than a governmentwide audit.The report closes by warning that “this year’s process fell short of a gold standard” and that the guardrails protecting national security and ethics must be “reviewed, revised and bolstered.”That recommendation carries a weight that the report itself cannot resolve: the vulnerabilities in the 2024–25 transition may not have ended on Inauguration Day.Until the government mandates the same identity governance rigor for transitions that it does for agencies, the question of who gained access - and who kept it - will remain unanswered.And given the stakes, that question can no longer be allowed to sit in silence.",https://www.biometricupdate.com/202511/identity-verification-processes-broke-down-during-trump-govt-transition-report

Trump is doing everything in his power to make sure Putin gets what he wants,"Almost lost among Donald Trump’s latest assault on America, has been his utter disdain for our democracy, and love for Russian President Vladimir Putin.Amid Trump’s attack on our government, White House, health-care, food benefits, vote, the arts, environment, our economy, and peace and quiet, the Russia-Ukraine War has raged on.Defying all odds, the Ukrainians and their gutsy, charismatic leader Volodymyr Zelenskyy, have held off the once-feared Russian army for nearly four years. This should be celebrated as one the most inspirational events of a 21st Century that has been sorely lacking inspiration or good.Putin and his vaunted army were supposed to cut through Ukraine like a knife through butter when they launched their attack on Feb. 24, 2022. When Putin’s army amassed on the Ukrainian border it was estimated by many experts that Ukraine would fall in mere hours.Except that never happened because the Ukrainians proved themselves more feisty and prepared, and Russia weaker and more clumsy, than all these experts expected.By the third day of fighting Zelenskyy was proving himself more than ready for what feeble Russia was bringing him, and produced a video watched my millions that turned down the United State’s invitation to evacuate him, saying:“The fight is here; I need ammunition, not a ride!”Something wonderful was happening on the eastern front, as a small, upstart and proud nation was smacking the murderous Putin and his army right in the mouth.It was scary, thrilling and good news to everybody it seems except for Putin and his puppet, Trump, who wasted no time alerting the world to what side he was on, calling Putin’s attack, “savvy” and “genius.”Just three days later, when he saw what was happening, as the valiant Ukrainians stood up to the bully, and “savvy genius,” Putin, the carnival-barking Trump changed his tone at a CPAC gathering in Florida, on February 27, 2022, and slobbered this:“The Russian attack on Ukraine is appalling. We are praying for the proud people of Ukraine. God bless them all.”After surviving this anti-democratic whiplash, instead of apologizing for his grotesque words praising Putin, Trump did what he always did, and has always done: He attacked the United States, and let Putin off the hook, saying:“The real problem is that our leaders are dumb, dumb. So dumb.”But Trump’s phony reversal, and attack on America, was only the subhead of that event in Florida, because he used that never-ending speech to hint loudly at another run for office by taking a swipe at America and its President, Joe Biden:“As everyone understands, this horrific disaster would never have happened if our election was not rigged and if I was the president ...”He went on:“In November 2024, Democrats will find out like never before. We did it twice, and we’ll do it again. We’re going to be doing it again, a third time.”Here’s where I will always point out with precision and rage that this anti-American, no-good monster should have been on his way to rotting in jail by now for his attack on our country that had occurred just one year earlier, on Jan. 6, 2021. Except Attorney General Merrick Garland still hadn’t even laid a glove on the traitor, Trump, and allowed him to reclaim his hold over a party that had proven itself morally busted, and incapable of standing up against Trump or Putin, and for America.Now four very painful years later, the proud Ukrainians are still holding off Russia, and Trump is still doing everything he can to make sure Russia prevails.As I type this, Trump has rolled out a U.S. peace plan this is so absurd even the cowards who helped enable him in the Republican Party are speaking out against it, saying it is nothing but a Russian wish list.Here is Sen. Thom Tillis (R-NC):“Putin is a murderer a rapist and an assassin. We should not do anything that makes him feel like he has a win here.”Here is Sen. Mitch McConnell, (R-KY):“If administration officials are more concerned with appeasing Putin than securing real peace, then the president ought to find new advisors.”I am aware that both of these men are not seeking reelection, which is why you can be assured they are both finally telling the truth.On Sunday, Trump was right back where he was four years ago, despite all the heroics of the Ukrainians since, blaming the United States, Ukraine and our allies for the attack, by blasting this out on his state-run social media channel:“With strong and proper U.S. and Ukrainian LEADERSHIP, Russia’s invasion of Ukraine would have NEVER HAPPENED.”“UKRAINE ‘LEADERSHIP’ HAS EXPRESSED ZERO GRATITUDE FOR OUR EFFORTS, AND EUROPE CONTINUES TO BUY OIL FROM RUSSIA.”Read that again, and try to tell me that Trump is not a traitor.Not a single word of condemnation at the aggressor and murderer, Putin. Only disdain for America, Ukraine, and our NATO allies whose relationship over the decades has been forged in blood and honor.Russia helped install Trump into office in 2016. We know this. In fact, nobody knows it better than his Secretary of State Marco Rubio, who chaired the Republican-led bipartisan committee who rendered these findings in August, 2020, which stated:The Trump campaign’s interactions with Russian intelligence services during the 2016 presidential election posed a “grave” counterintelligence threat.This is from a PBS story that went into the 1,000-page report. It was the fifth and final one from the Republican-led Senate intelligence committee on the Russia investigation:“The findings, including unflinching characterizations of furtive interactions between Trump associates and Russian operatives, echo to a large degree those of special counsel Robert Mueller’s Russia investigation and appear to repudiate the Republican president’s claims that the FBI had no basis to investigate whether his campaign was conspiring with Russia. Trump has called the Russia investigations a “hoax.”Cold irony then that it is the feckless Rubio who seems to be caught in the middle of unfriendly fire right now between Trump and the rest of the free world as his boss attacks the United States and makes excuses for Putin with his pathetic excuse for a “peace plan.”From AP reporting:Lawmakers critical of President Donald Trump’s approach to ending the Russia-Ukraine war said Saturday they spoke with Secretary of State Marco Rubio who told them that the peace plan Trump is pushing Kyiv to accept is a “wish list” of the Russians and not the actual proposal offering Washington’s positions.A State Department spokesperson denied their account, calling it “blatantly false.”Rubio himself then took the extraordinary step of suggesting online that the senators were mistaken, even though they said he was their source for the information. The secretary of state doubled down on the assertion that Washington was responsible for a proposal that had surprised many from the beginning for being so favorable to Moscow.“For being so favorable to Moscow ...”Shocking, eh?So here we are again. Donald Trump is doing everything in his seemingly unlimited power to make sure Putin gets what he wants after starting this illegal and immoral war against Ukraine.He is clearly in the tank FOR Russia and AGAINST America.Just what in the hell is going here????D.

Trump Foe Banned From Venice After Turning Canal Green,"Dan Kitwood / Dan Kitwood/Getty ImagesGreta Thunberg, climate change activist, was banned from Venice following a protest that dyed the Grand Canal green. Thunberg, 22, joined Extinction Rebellion, an environmental group, to dye the city’s tourist attraction with a green non-toxic tracer, as an act of protest. The group hung a banner on the Rialto Bridge that said “stop ecocide,” a slogan used to highlight “the massive effects of climate change.” The public demonstration drew attention when protesters wearing red veils walked around crowds of tourists. The protest group also dyed other waterways in several Italian cities, including Milan, Palermo, and Bologna. Veneto’s governor, Luca Zaia, condemned the protest, calling it an act that “wounds” the city of Venice. Radical environmental protests have increased in the past few years. In 2022, protesters defaced historic art, including throwing food onto Van Gogh’s “Sunflowers” in London. Two protesters from the Declare Emergency climate activist group flung red and black paint at the Edgar Degas sculpture at the National Gallery of Art in Washington, D.C. Zaia took to Instagram, writing, “These acts damage Venice, require restoration work, and—paradoxically—generate pollution.” Thunberg’s Venice ban lasted only 48 hours, and she was fined $172, along with dozens of other protesters.

Elton John: How Trump Could Be ‘Greatest President’ in History,"Dave Benett / Dave Benett/Getty Images for BurberryPresident Donald Trump’s favorite singer has opened up about how he could go down as “one of the greatest presidents in history.” Elton John, 78, who in 1992 established what is now the fifth-largest HIV philanthropic funder in the world, told Variety that if the president manages to end AIDS, it would “really be a feather in his cap.” Although the president launched an initiative during his first term to end the HIV epidemic in the U.S by 2030, reports indicate that in his second term, funding to the U.S. President’s Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief (PEPFAR), which has saved around 26 million lives globally since its inception in 2003, has been cut. “The bipartisan thing makes common sense,” the singer said about working together to cure the disease. John has previously acknowledged that Trump is his fan, telling Variety in 2024 that the president has attended his concerts “many times.” He later clarified on Instagram that this did not mean he supported Trump in the election. “I don’t go on stage and say to people, ‘you mustn’t vote for the Republicans, you mustn’t vote for the Democrats.’ It’s none of my business how they vote,” the singer wrote, quoting and sharing a clip of the interview that had received less attention.

Trump takes 6-day vacation to Mar-a-Lago while Americans struggle with skyrocketing prices,"President Donald Trump is heading to his Florida estate on Tuesday to get a jump on the Thanksgiving holiday. The president and First Lady will be staying at Mar-a-Lago for an extended break, returning to the White House early Sunday evening.As the First Family enjoys their six-day trip, Americans are increasingly dismayed at the state of the Trump economy, which is producing near-record-low consumer sentiment, rising and record prices at the grocery store, increasing unemployment, persistent inflation, and — as the president recently declared — tariff payments that are about to “skyrocket.”Inflation remains strong at 3.0%. The unemployment rate is now the highest it’s been in nearly four years. Prices for items like beef, coffee, and bananas have increased by double-digit percentages. Major corporations have announced plans to lay off thousands or tens of thousands of workers. Millions of Americans are seeing their health care premiums for next year in some cases double or even triple. And according to one economist, there is a possibility that some parts of the country may already be in a recession. Another economist last week sounded the stagflation alarm.READ MORE: Family Food Costs Hit Record High Despite Trump Touting Cheaper Holiday DinnerAccording to guidance from the White House, published by Roll Call, the president and First Lady will head to Palm Beach, Florida, at 6 PM on Tuesday, after pardoning the presidential turkeys.The president has no public events scheduled on Wednesday.

What the Comey and James dismissals mean for bungling Trump,"By Ray Brescia, Associate Dean for Research and Intellectual Life, Albany Law School. On Monday, a federal judge dismissed the indictments against former FBI Director James B. Comey and New York Attorney General Letitia James, blocking the Department of Justice’s efforts to prosecute two of President Donald Trump’s perceived adversaries.But U.S. District Judge Cameron McGowan Currie qualified her dismissals, saying she did so “without prejudice.”What does that legal term mean?Unaddressed chargesIn her ruling, Currie concluded that the appointment of interim U.S. Attorney Lindsey Halligan, who filed the cases against Comey and James, was unlawful. Currie wrote:“Because Ms. Halligan had no lawful authority to present the indictment, I will grant Mr. Comey’s motion and dismiss the indictment without prejudice.”She wrote the same about the case against James.Currie’s “without prejudice” reference means the dismissal did not address what legal scholars like me call the merits or substance of the underlying criminal charges.A “without prejudice” dismissal is legalese for “you can try again if you can fix the problems with your case.” Had the judge ruled that the dismissals were “with prejudice,” that would have meant the government could not have brought the cases again.Here’s what prosecutors would need to fix to be able to bring cases against Comey and James again.Federal law provides that whenever a U.S. attorney’s position is vacant, the attorney general may appoint an interim U.S. attorney for a period of 120 days. At the end of that period, it’s up to the federal judges of the district where that position is vacant to appoint someone to continue in that role unless and until the president nominates, and the Senate confirms, a U.S. attorney through the normal appointments process.The Trump administration appointed Halligan’s predecessor, U.S. Attorney Erik Siebert, in that interim role in January 2025. And when the 120 days from his appointment lapsed, the district judges of the Eastern District of Virginia selected him to continue on in his interim role.Currie found that when Siebert resigned after his reappointment, that did not empower the Trump administration to appoint a new interim prosecutor. The power still resided with the District Court judges. Because of that, Halligan’s appointment and her efforts to secure the Comey and James indictments were void.The end of the beginningThe Department of Justice can certainly appeal these rulings and could get them reversed on appeal, or it could refile them after a new U.S. attorney is named in accordance with law.It may be too late for the case against Comey, however, because the statute of limitations on those charges has already run out. As Currie noted in her Comey ruling, while the statute of limitations is generally suspended when a valid indictment has been filed, an invalid indictment, like the one against Comey, would not have the same effect on the statute of limitations.That means the time has likely run out on the claims against the former FBI director.If Currie’s rulings stand, the Justice Department can’t just file the cases again, with Halligan still in this role, unless the Trump administration follows the procedures set forth in the law for her proper appointment.While this is not the beginning of the end for these prosecutions, it is, at least, the end of the beginning.",https://www.rawstory.com/james-comey-2674341208/

'Disappointment and irritation': Saudi crown prince slaps down Trump over Israel strategy,"President Donald Trump and Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman (MBS) had a tense disagreement behind closed doors last week over Saudi Arabia's relationship with Israel and the president's desire for the country to join the Abraham Accords. Trump had asked MBS to consider joining the peace deal, and the Saudi leader demanded that in return for a peace deal, he would consider it if Israel agreed to ""an irreversible, credible and time-bound path"" for a Palestinian state, Axios reported on Tuesday. Israel has said it would oppose a Palestinian state. The president was apparently upset by the prince's response and had hoped he would agree to normalizing the relationship between Saudi Arabia and Israel, the report states. ""The best way to say it is disappointment and irritation. The president really wants them to join the Abraham Accords. He tried very hard to talk to him. It was an honest discussion. But MBS is a strong man. He stood his ground,"" a source told Axios.MBS made it clear after the meeting, publicly, that it was his position. ""MBS never said no to normalization. The door is open for doing it later. But the two-state solution is an issue,"" a U.S. official told Axios.The conversation was reportedly civil — but tough. Trump had expected to make more progress on the foreign policy, which was first signed in 2020, aimed to improve diplomatic ties between Israel and several other Arab nations in the region. Trump considered it a major diplomatic win in his first term. ""Now that Iran's nuclear program has been totally obliterated and the war in Gaza has ended, it is very important to President Trump that all Middle Eastern countries join the Abraham Accords, which will advance peace in the region,"" a White House official told the outlet.MBS told Trump that Saudis are not ready to normalize relations with Israel following the Gaza war, which has killed more than 67,000 people, according to Reuters. Nearly a third of those people were children. ""MBS explained to Trump that although he wants to move forward with normalization with Israel, he can't do so now because Saudi public opinion is highly anti-Israel in the aftermath of the Gaza war. He said Saudi society isn't ready for such a move now,"" three sources told the outlet.",https://www.rawstory.com/mohammed-bin-salman-donald-trump-2674341957/

Conservative reveals how GOP may abandon Trump if they lose big in the midterms,"Even though President Donald Trump has thoroughly dominated the Republican Party since his 2016 election victory, the GOP may finally walk away from him if they suffer major losses in next year's midterm elections.That's according to conservative columnist Jonathan V. Last, who wrote in the Bulwark on Tuesday that the Republican Party's love devotion to Trump may finally end depending on the outcome of the 2026 elections. He wrote that while Trump briefly fell out of favor with Republicans after the January 6, 2021 insurrection, the party never seriously walked away from the president as it continued to entertain his election denialism and overwhelmingly backed his return to the White House in 2024.Last pointed out that despite previous losses with Trump at the helm – like the 2018 midterms and the 2020 presidential election – the president still managed to further cement his grip on the party. However, with Republicans only holding a slim four-seat majority in the House of Representatives, and the GOP having lost by large margins in multiple states' off-year elections earlier this month, Last wrote that a stinging defeat for Republicans was very much in the cards next year. And should that happen, Last offered three scenarios.First, the conservative writer acknowledged the possibility that Republicans still cling to Trump following a blowout loss in the midterms. He cited the previous 2018 example, but pointed out that the key difference in 2026 is that Trump is now a lame-duck president (despite his entertaining of an illegal and unconstitutional third term). He suggested that in 2027 and beyond, Trump may rely on ""leaning into authoritarianism while juicing the economy"" given that Federal Reserve chair Jerome Powell's term is due to expire and the president will have a ""pliant chairman"" to lead the Fed.However, Last said ""party functionaries"" within the GOP could push Trump aside if Republicans lose the House of Representatives next year, akin to how Democratic Party leaders forced President Joe Biden into retirement after his June 2024 debate with Trump. He posited that Vice President JD Vance could form a 2028 exploratory committee, Cabinet members quit the administration and oppose Trump from the right or the GOP's next minority leader could pin the blame for the party's losses on Trump.A third scenario last predicted was Trump having a ""health event"" that would lead to the president being ""gracefully ushered off stage"" by party leadership, and said this would likely be ""what every Republican not related to Trump by blood is secretly hoping for.""""This is a potential danger for all mafia dons and strongmen, which is why they tend to surround themselves in their later years with the people most likely to remain loyal in all circumstances. (Translation: family.),"" Last wrote. ""My point in all of this is to try to convince you that change is coming.""",https://www.rawstory.com/alternet-posts/conservative-gop-abandon-trump/

'Miserable' House Republicans tell ex-colleague of 'toxic' work conditions under Trump,"An ex-GOP lawmaker came clean on what it's like to work for ""toxic"" President Donald Trump — and what he believes is happening behind the scenes among Republicans. Former Rep. David Trott (R-MI), in an opinion piece published in The Daily Beast on Tuesday, wrote about why the Republican majority is falling apart — and the difficult position Trump has put it in. ""Republicans in particular have an untenable choice—stand up to President Trump’s unconstitutional actions or fall in line and accomplish nothing,"" Trott wrote. Trott described his experience in Congress during Trump's first term 10 years ago. ""Most of my peers were more capable and intelligent than the media portrayed them, although the place was completely dysfunctional. It still is. And it’s gotten worse. More toxic. The focus is on winning—i.e., beating the other party—and playing the blame game, not solving problems,"" Trott wrote. He now sees a different problem for his Republican colleagues. ""Members I have kept in touch with are miserable, and the deplorable state of affairs in our Capitol today is certainly a driving factor behind many recent lawmakers’ resignations,"" he wrote. ""One senior Republican recently told Punchbowl that 'his entire White House team has treated ALL members like garbage... And Mike Johnson has let it happen because he wanted it to happen.'”Referring to the president as ""King Trump,"" Trott reveals how the situation has worsened. ""I was there during some of his first term, yes, but Trump was not as adept at abusing his power back then—I can’t imagine serving today just waiting for him to tell me what to do or how to vote,"" Trott explained.Bipartisanship and focusing on results could help lawmakers get out of the situation, but Trott does not expect it to improve anytime soon, especially while the focus for GOP leaders appears to be job security and not serving the American public. ""Let’s be clear, Trump’s executive branch is being run by a bunch of sycophants, felons, and idiots. (Well, former felons—they’ve all been pardoned.) Break the law, go to prison, cut a check, and become a special advisor to the president—what a great country we live in! The Senate confirmed Trump’s picks for key Cabinet roles, ambassadorships, and many more positions of power with blind loyalty being the only criterion,"" Trott added.",https://www.rawstory.com/donald-trump-republicans-miserable/

'Find the votes': Trump threatens to primary Republicans who don't support election scheme,"President Donald Trump threatened on Tuesday that he would not support Republicans who refuse to go along with his election scheme during the 2026 midterm. One of the ways Trump is seeking to sway the 2026 midterm in his favor is by pressuring state legislatures to undergo mid-cycle redistricting, which allows them to redraw their congressional maps. The Texas legislature was the first to redraw its maps, which sparked backlash from Democratic-controlled states like California and Maryland. Recently, Indiana Republicans announced that they would take up the redistricting issue during their next session. The announcement comes about a month after the state legislature failed to pass a new election map because some Republicans did not vote for the measure. Trump responded to the news in a new Truth Social post. ""I am glad to hear the Indiana House is stepping up to do the right thing, and I hope the Senate finds the Votes. If they do, I will make sure that all of those people supporting me win their Primaries, and go on to Greatness but if they don’t, I will partner with the incredibly powerful MAGA Grassroots Republicans to elect STRONG Republicans who are ready to do what is needed to protect our Country and, MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!""

Inside the Trump administration’s dicey play to block states from regulating AI,"Spurred to action by tech industry lobbyists and insiders, Republicans in the Senate appear to be planning to add language to the National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) that would preempt states from passing laws regulating AI labs. Two sources with knowledge tell Fast Company that a small group of GOP lawmakers, staffers, and tech lobbyists worked through the weekend crafting the new language. Heading into Thanksgiving, much uncertainty hangs over the fate of the state-level moratorium – and a fair amount of secrecy about how the AI industry and its MAGA allies will try to tie the hands of states, and Congress, to regulate AI. Democrats and others may not be allowed to see the new language until the vote to pass or reject the NDAA, a so-called “must-pass” bill that funds the military. Senate Democrats also have no visibility on the scope of the moratorium language that will go in the NDAA. Could it, for example, prevent states from passing any and all kinds of AI laws, including those that focus on consumer protection issues or AI-related unemployment?“What big tech is trying to do here is an even larger giveaway than Section 230,” says Future of Life Institute’s head of U.S. policy Michael Kleinman. (Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act of 1996 exempted tech platforms from liability for user-generated content.) “You literally have big tech lobbyists meeting with a handful of senior Republicans trying over the course of a holiday weekend to craft legislation that will govern what state governments can do around AI for the future–it’s appalling.”Not long after Louisiana Republican Steve Scalise, the House Majority Leader, introduced the preemption measure last week, Massachusetts Democratic Senators Elizabeth Warren and Ed Markey quickly penned and sent a letter to their colleagues urging them to oppose adding the state moratorium — which they describe as a “poison pill” — to the NDAA, which will need 60 GOP votes to end a Democratic filibuster and advance to a final vote. Attorneys General representing 36 states sent a letter to Congressional leadership opposing the state moratorium language. Congress is not in session because of the Thanksgiving holiday. But Republicans plan to make another push to convince lawmakers to add the state preemption to the NDAA when they return December 1, sources say. Last week, the White House proposed a route that bypasses Congress, circulating a draft executive order (EO) that proposes pulling back congressionally approved broadband funding from any state enacting new AI laws. The EO also proposed creating a new Department of Justice task force to challenge existing state AI laws. The White House had reportedly planned to release the EO last Friday, but chose to delay it.Many of the people who would benefit from a state AI moratorium were present at a November 18 White House state dinner hosted by President Donald Trump for Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman. These include Elon Musk, Jeff Bezos, Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang, OpenAI’s Greg Brockman, AMD CEO Lisa Su, and Apple CEO Tim Cook. David Sacks, Trump’s “AI and crypto czar” and venture capitalist, was also among the attendees. Given the import of stifling AI regulation whenever and wherever possible, it’s very likely that the state AI law moratorium was discussed while these people were in Washington for the event, one Washington source said.Texas Republican Senator Ted Cruz tried last summer to tuck the preemption into the so-called One Big Beautiful Bill Act (an appropriations measure) last summer, but senators voted 99-1 to remove it. The moratorium idea is unpopular with the public, survey data shows, and unpopular across the political spectrum in Washington DC. Despite broad opposition, tech industry insiders such as Marc Andreessen, Elon Musk, and Sacks have Trump’s ear, and have helped keep the state preemption idea alive in the Capitol. Big tech’s big opportunityIn a broad sense, the chance to keep government oversight away from what could be the most impactful technology in a generation may explain why tech moguls and opinion leaders threw their support behind Donald Trump before the 2024 election and have continued to praise and appease him. While the Trump administration rewards his tech industry allies by killing government inquiries and regulation, big U.S. tech companies and financiers are now sinking trillions into building the infrastructure needed to support a massive expansion of generative AI.The AI industry has been ramping up its lobbying spend over the past two years to stifle AI regulation at both the federal and state levels. It’s also expanding into electoral politics. This summer a group of AI companies and investors launched a super PAC worth $100 million called “Leading the Future” that will push “pro-AI” candidates and oppose pro-AI regulation candidates. Backers include a16z, OpenAI President Greg Brockman, Palantir co-founder Joe Lonsdale, Perplexity AI, and angel investor Ron Conway. On a legal level, some in the tech industry, including the venture capital firm Andreessen Horowitz, argue that state laws should focus on the application, not the development, of AI–such as to prevent or punish things like fraud or civil rights violations–while federal law should govern the “national AI market.” AI companies also fear being burdened by a “patchwork” of state AI regulations instead of a single set of federal rules. Tom Kemp, who directs the California Privacy Protection Agency, explains that in many tech policy issues there’s a debate over the boundary between issues covered by federal law and issues covered by state law. But Congress hasn’t come close to passing a broad AI safety and transparency law, and isn’t likely to. “The fundamental issue they have is that there’s no federal backstop,” Kemp says. “So the moratorium basically says you just can’t do any laws having to do with AI.”Innovation versus states’ rightsMany state governors, including Florida Republican Ron DeSantis, and legislators, claim they have not just a right but a responsibility to enact AI laws to protect the public in the absence of a federal law. State lawmakers are very aware of the series of reports about AI chatbots exacerbating mental health problems in users, including younger ones. “There’s a big concern that state legislators cannot protect kids from some of the harms of AI,” Kemp says. On Monday, a bipartisan group of 280 state lawmakers from across the country sent a letter to lawmakers in the House and Senate opposing the state AI law preemption, saying it would hamstring their efforts to address the impacts of artificial intelligence.The tech lobby and its Republican allies frame the moratorium as critical to helping the U.S. maintain its lead in AI — technology that will be increasingly used in defense and national security. But even the top players in defense don’t seem convinced. “You need the four corners of the armed forces committees to be all approved,” says Kemp, who met with lawmakers last week in Washington to discuss the issue. In other words, the majority and minority leaders of both the House and Senate Armed Services Committees have to agree to insert state AI preemption language into the NDAA. Kemp believes that Alabama Republican Rep. Mike Rogers, the chairman of the House Committee on Armed Services, and Washington Democratic Rep. Adam Smith, the committee’s ranking member, are opposed, as is Senate Committee on Armed Services ranking member Jack Reed. Mississippi Republican Senator Roger Wicker, the chairman of the committee, has yet to announce his position.It’s possible that new language in the NDAA will go beyond a state-level pre-emption, and promote some form of broad, but weak, federal AI law that limits oversight by both federal and state regulators. On Monday the Leading the Future PAC launched a $10 million campaign to push Congress to craft a “national AI policy” that would override a patchwork of state laws, reports CNBC.“What we’re seeing, not just with preemption, but with these big tech super PACs is that big tech will go to any effort to undermine that overwhelming small-D democratic will,” Kleinman says. “All the polling that we have done and that others have done shows that consistently across the board strong majorities of both parties support AI regulation.”",https://www.fastcompany.com/91447443/ai-regulation-states-trump-warren-scalise

It was published at a time when Patel's FBI was facing growing criticism over its use of resources and its investigations into Trump's political enemies. The ""unflattering headlines"" have reportedly prompted Trump to confide in his allies about his concerns over the embarrassing stories, MS NOW's report added. Three people aware of the situation spoke anonymously and told MS NOW that Trump is considering cutting Patel and putting Andrew Bailey as the FBI's new director. Bailey is a top agency official. Patel's ouster ""appears closer than ever, with Bailey as the logical replacement, two of the sources with knowledge of the situation said, though Trump could change his mind in the weeks to come,"" MS NOW reported.

'Crisis': Expert slams Trump for deporting student for years-old case she wasn't aware of,"President Donald Trump's administration summarily shipped a college student out of the country over an order from years ago that she wasn't even aware of, not even giving her time to realize she needed a lawyer, a legal expert wrote on Tuesday.The individual, a Babson College freshman, was detained at Boston's Logan International Airport while she was heading home. Within 48 hours, she had been deported to Honduras, a country she had not lived in since the age of six.This action stunned Aaron Reichlin-Melnick of the American Immigration Council.""This college student ended up deported without any further court hearing because when she was a child, unbeknownst to her, she was ordered deported,"" wrote Reichlin-Melnick, a frequent critic of the Trump administration's deportation policies, in a post on X. ""She had no idea, so she didn’t even know to have a lawyer try to reopen the case before it became a crisis.""The Trump administration has increasingly been under a magnifying glass over its attempts to get immigrants removed from the country by any means necessary, often with little to nothing resembling due process.One of the most high-profile cases has been that of Salvadoran immigrant Kilmar Abrego Garcia, who was accused by the administration of gang activity with little evidence and summarily deported to the foreign CECOT megaprison, despite a federal judge's order preventing his deportation to that country. After months of outcry and wrangling, the administration relented from its previous claims that he could not be repatriated and brought him back to the United States — then immediately charged him with new, shakily-sourced gang offenses and tried several times to ship him to various countries in Africa, in a process legal experts have criticized as a farce.",https://www.rawstory.com/deportation-2674341863/
