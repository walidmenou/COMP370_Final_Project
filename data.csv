The new monthly CPI series showed headline inflation rising 3.8% y/y in October, the fastest in ten months and above the 3.6% median forecast, marking a fourth straight month of re-acceleration since the June trough. The trimmed mean rose to 3.3%, continuing its upward trend and staying above the RBA’s 2–3% target band.

The data gave the Australian dollar a solid lift.Across the Tasman, the Reserve Bank of New Zealand cut its official cash rate target by 25bps to 2.25%, the lowest since mid-2022, but signalled the easing cycle is effectively over. The Bank now projects the OCR to hold around 2.25% in early 2026 before rising to 2.65% by late 2027, guidance that shuts the door on further cuts. Markets reacted quickly: the New Zealand dollar rallied about 1% to a one-week high and two-year swaps jumped.The yen strengthened on rising expectations of a near-term Bank of Japan rate hike, with USD/JPY and yen crosses broadly lower.

Trump admin hikes national parks prices by up to $170 for international tourists,"The Trump administration is raising national parks' prices and adding fees for international tourists from next year in an ""America-first"" initiative that'll see U.S. residents ""continue to enjoy affordable pricing,"" the Interior Department announced Tuesday.The big picture: The new fees that take effect from Jan. 1 follow a tumultuous year for the National Park Service after hundreds of workers were fired in the Trump administration's purge of federal employees, and Axios' Emily Peck reports international air travel has declined amid travelers saying they're put off by tariffs.Driving the news: Under the ""America-first"" entry fee policies, ""nonresidents will pay a higher rate to help support the care and maintenance of America's parks,"" said the Interior Department, which manages federal land, in a statement Tuesday.It will also hold ""resident-only patriotic fee-free days"" on the 110th birthday of the National Park Service and on holidays in 2026 including Flag Day, which the statement notes is President Trump's birthday.By the numbers: While the cost of an annual parks pass for U.S. residents will remain at $80, international travelers will from Jan. 1 have to pay $250 — an increase of $170.Non-residents without an annual pass will from that date have to pay a $100 per person fee in addition to the standard entrance fee to visit each of the 11 most popular national parks, including the Grand Canyon, Yosemite and Yellowstone.Zoom in: ""Under the new system, the America the Beautiful passes — including Annual, Military, Senior, 4th Grade and Access — will be available in a fully digital format through Recreation.gov,"" per the statement.""In addition, the National Park Service is expanding affordability and access for motorcycle riders. All America the Beautiful passes will now cover two motorcycles per pass.""What they're saying: Interior Secretary Doug Burgum said in a video posted to X the price hike for international travelers ""ensures they contribute their fair share to help preserve and maintain these treasured places.""Go deeper: Why foreign travelers are avoiding the U.S."

Judge gives Justice Department a day to detail Ghislaine Maxwell trial materials to be released,"NEW YORK — A federal judge in Manhattan is demanding more information from the Justice Department as he weighs its request to unseal records from the sex trafficking case against Jeffrey Epstein’s longtime confidante Ghislaine Maxwell.Judge Paul A. Engelmayer on Tuesday ordered the Justice Department to tell him what materials it plans to publicly release that were subject to secrecy orders in the British socialite’s case.The deadline: Noon on Wednesday.Engelmayer's order came after the Justice Department on Monday asked for his permission to release grand jury records, exhibits and discovery materials in the Maxwell case.Engelmayer said government lawyers must file a letter on the case docket describing materials it wants to release “in sufficient detail to meaningfully inform victims” what it plans to make public.Maxwell was convicted in 2021 by a federal jury of sex trafficking for helping recruit some of Epstein’s underage victims. She is serving a 20-year prison sentence.Epstein, a millionaire money manager known for socializing with celebrities, politicians, billionaires and the academic elite, killed himself in jail a month after his 2019 arrest.Engelmayer had already notified victims and Maxwell that they can respond next month to Justice Department’s request to release materials before he decides whether to grant it.The Justice Department said it was seeking the court's approval to release materials to comply with the Epstein Files Transparency Act, passed by Congress and signed into law last week by President Donald Trump. It calls for the release of grand jury and discovery materials in the case.The request, along with an identical one for grand jury transcripts from Epstein’s case, was among the first public indications that the Justice Department was trying to comply with the transparency act, which requires it to release Epstein-related files in a searchable format by Dec. 19.Engelmayer did not preside over the trial, but was assigned to the case after the trial judge, Alison J. Nathan, was elevated to the 2nd US Circuit Court of Appeals.Discovery materials subject to secrecy orders are likely to include victim interviews and other materials that previously would have been only viewed by lawyers or Maxwell prior to her trial.Engelmayer said in an order Monday that Maxwell and victims of Maxwell and Epstein can respond by Dec. 3 to the government’s request to make materials public. The government must respond to their filings by Dec. 10. The judge said he will rule “promptly thereafter.”Lawyers for victims did not immediately respond to messages seeking comment. A spokesperson for federal prosecutors declined to comment.Judge Richard M. Berman, who presided over the Epstein case before his death, issued an order on Tuesday allowing victims and Epstein's estate to respond to the Justice Department's unsealing request by Dec. 3. He said the government can respond to any submissions by Dec. 8.Berman said he would make his “best efforts to resolve this motion promptly.”"

Escobar: The European Matryoshka Of Irrelevance,"Escobar: The European Matryoshka Of Irrelevance Authored by Pepe Escobar,The EU/NATO combo cannot but play the role of pathetic yapping chihuahuas. That’s the price you pay for a matrioshka of supreme stupidity.No one ever lost money betting on the politically suicidal instincts of post-Orwellian EU – that acronym for a virtual Europe.Call them juvenile bipolar psychos or a bunch of yapping chihuahuas: no Jupiterian or Mercurial voice of reason has been capable to impart to the “leadership” in Brussels and their vassals in most European capitals – yes, there are healthy exceptions – that losers in wars do not dictate terms.And still those War Council luminaries – with a special starring role for the toxic Pfizer Medusa and her Estonian sidekick unable to even manage a herring stall in the Baltics – insist that essentially the mega-corrupt gang in Kiev must prevail, to the last Ukrainian dead, and on top of it dictate the final terms of their non-surrender.Reality begs to differ. Plan A was never to talk, much less negotiate with Russia. And still there’s no Plan B.So after the 28-pointer Theater of the Absurd – which is not even Trump’s plan, but a mish mash concocted by the Witkoff-Dmitriev duo plus “insights” from neo-con Rubio and toxic Zionist asset Jared Kushner – the cross-yapping went ballistic, leading to an emergency “counter-plan” that is, what else, a Loser’s Manifesto.Even Rubio allowed himself a shining moment: “What plan?” Might as well call it The Euro-kiss of Death.Russia, meanwhile, behaves like Lao Tzu surrounded by rabid stray dogs. The conditions for a negotiation have been set in detail by Putin since June 2024. These are non-negotiable, and would allow the negotiation to start: Kiev withdraws from the four regions and formally pledges to never enter NATO.One of the EU’s “counter-plan” points is a 30-day ceasefire, with all territorial disputes to be debated afterwards. So that means everything frozen on the current front line, and no Ukraine withdrawal from the parts of Donbass they still occupy.None of that – and much more – is remotely acceptable to the actual winner of the war, Russia. It would not be acceptable even if NATO troops were entering Moscow tomorrow.So the “counter-plan”, elaborated in conjunction with the unimaginably corrupt Kiev combo, is essentially a sabotage op to buy some extra time and buy some $6 trillion in – American – weapons – for their amply avowed Forever War. Fine with Moscow – as the SMO will keep going on, rolling thunder mode.Losers bombing a peace planThe EU’s 24-point counter-plan contains nuggets such as Ukraine receiving legally binding security guarantees from the Empire of Chaos and its vassals: a de facto NATO Article 5 scam with different terminology.Plus no restrictions on Ukraine’s armed forces and defense industry; control of the Zaporozhye Nuclear Power Plant (with the Empire of Chaos in the mix) and the Kakhovka Dam; unhindered access to the Dnieper River and control of the Kinburn Spit.And the killer: Ukraine “financially compensated” – including through the stolen, so far, Russian sovereign assets, which will remain stolen until Moscow pays compensation.As for sanctions, they “may” – that’s the operative word – be “partially” – another operative word – eased only after a “sustainable peace”, with automatic snap-back if the deal is violated. Translation: the West can sanction Russia again anytime they see fit. No word on provocations by the EU/NATO using Ukraine – the actual set up that led to the SMO.So what the “counter-plan” proposes – obviously redacted by a bunch of Eurocrats who cannot even fire a pistol properly – is a replica of the exact blueprint that led to the battlefield opened in February 2022.Russia once again is playing it with boundless patience. The Trump plan which is not really Trump’s is diplomatically regarded as a “good foundation” for further serious negotiations – with the yapping crowd having no access to the table. That’s it – at best.After all Russia is enjoying a series of overlapping asymmetric advantages in the battlefield: systemic and tactical adaptation; enormous advantage in drone operations (FPV drones with fiber-optics); use of long-range glide bombs.The chihuahua “counter-plan” essentially calls for a frozen war; a remilitarized Ukraine; a remilitarized NATO; and ultimately a perennial Forever War against Russia. It has already bombed, metaphorically, the original Trump plan that is not exactly Trump’s.The “counter-plan” should also be seen as a diversionist tactic now that the dark pit of corruption in Kiev starts to be pried upon by the NABU investigation – even as Russian UN representative Nebenzya had been warning the UN Security Council since forever that “you were dealing with a corrupt gang that is profiting from the war”.Nebenzya also correctly observed that not a single Western country has said a word about the corruption scandal in Kiev. Of course: because a proper investigation will inevitably follow the corruption chain of command all the way to decision making circles in Washington and in Brussels.The metaphysical void of EU “elites”Emmanuel Todd, in his ground-breaking The Defeat of the West, published in France early last year (the first review in English is here) was the first European analyst to get deeper into the EU malaise, side by side with his comprehensive analysis of the proxy war in Ukraine.Recently, in an outstanding lecture in Hiroshima, Todd made a startling correlation between Russophobia and Protestantism. Certain passages are worth quoting at length:“What we have seen appear recently in Europe is a specifically European Russophobia, a specifically European warmongering, centered on Northern Europe, on Protestant Europe. Protestant Europe is the United Kingdom, it’s the majority of Germany, it’s Scandinavia, it’s two out of three Baltic countries.”At the same time, Todd has observed that “Spain, Italy, Catholic countries in general, are neither Russophobic nor hawkish.”Todd’s key argument is that protestantism “is more dangerous in its zero state than Catholicism”: “Protestantism is more capable of leaving behind a nihilistic society. Protestantism, and the same could be said of Judaism, was a very demanding religion. There was God, there was the faithful, and the world was secondary. The beauty of the world in particular was rejected with, among other things, a refusal of images, a refusal of the visual arts. When such religions, obsessed with transcendence, disappear, nothing remains. The world itself is not interesting, empty. This intense void opens up a particular possibility of nihilism. Catholicism is a less demanding, more humane religion that can accept the idea that the world is, in itself, beautiful. The images have not been rejected in the Catholic world, and the Catholic world is filled with artistic wonders. In a Catholic country, if you lose God, you are left with the feeling of this beauty of the world. If you are French, you still have the feeling that you live — an illusion no doubt — in the most beautiful country in the world.”Well, it’s slightly more nuanced. What about the – vicious – Crusades and the Spanish Inquisition? Germany was in fact forced by a massive P.R. campaign to become Russophobic, unlike the Baltic chihuahuas. Most of Protestant Europe is in fact atheistic – and the next step from atheism is nihilism. Romania is mostly Christian Orthodox – where hatred of Russia is like a national sport. And Protestantism was essentially Christianity turbo-charged to the Age of Capital. So the main conflict is in fact Western turbo-Neoliberalism v. Christian Orthodox Russia.Back to the basics.Everyone with an IQ over room temperature knows that the NATO regime in Kiev runs on theft and outright plunder. The lights are now off. Heating is mostly off. The army is steadily collapsing all along the 1,200+ km frontline.Yet the EU elites – the set up in Brussels just follows their orders – have invested no holds barred in the inevitable (in their dreams) collapse and looting of Russia. That’s why there was never a Plan B.If the EU folds now, if they admit they are the irretrievable losers in this absurdist adventure, the economic collapse will be epic. The EU/NATO combo cannot but play the role of pathetic yapping chihuahuas. That’s the price you pay for a matryoshka of supreme stupidity: to provoke and threaten a superpower with the most advanced nuclear and hypersonic arsenal on the planet. Their current “victory” is to bomb Trump’s already shaky “peace” plan.So many horrors, so little time. On a more auspicious note, let’s give Todd the last word:“If you are Italian, you actually live in the country in the world where there are the most beautiful things, since Italy itself has become an object of art. In such contexts, the fear of the metaphysical void is less intense, and therefore the risk of nihilism less. In my opinion, the country in Europe least threatened by nihilism is Italy, because in Italy everything is beautiful”.So shed your metaphysical void, dump those chihuahuas of war, and embrace the beauty of Italy as a living work of art. That’s exactly what I’m doing next.Views expressed in this article are opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect the views of ZeroHedge. Tyler DurdenTue, 11/25/2025 - 23:25"
Brazil court orders Bolsonaro to start 27-year prison sentence,"Brazil’s Supreme Court on Tuesday ordered former far-right President Jair Bolsonaro to begin a 27-year prison sentence for a coup plot against his successor, a climax to years of political turmoil and legal battles over his contentious legacy in Brazilian democracy.The top court formally concluded the case against Bolsonaro on Tuesday, making his conviction final, pending confirmation by a four-member Supreme Court panel in the evening.The panel already rejected his appeal this month.Justice Alexandre de Moraes told Bolsonaro to start serving his sentence in the Federal Police Superintendency in Brasilia, where he has been detained since Saturday after he tampered with his ankle monitor while under house arrest in a separate case.The decision was the latest setback for a politician who rose from the far right fringe to the presidency in 2019, reshaping national debates with a populist style, appeals to military nostalgia, and polarising stances that left the country deeply divided.Since leaving office in 2022, Bolsonaro has now been convicted, barred from public office and abandoned by one-time ally US President Donald Trump, who has started reversing steep tariffs imposed to punish Bolsonaro’s prosecution.“Today is a memorable day for Brazilian democracy,” Congressman Lindbergh Farias said on X.“For the first time in our history, we are seeing a former president of the Republic and generals being arrested for a coup d’état.”One of the ex-president’s lawyers, Celso Vilardi, said the court rushed to conclude the case and should have allowed more time for appeals.His attorneys said they will continue to fight to challenge the outcome.Bolsonaro was sentenced in September to 27 years and three months in prison for plotting a coup after losing the 2022 presidential election to leftist current President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva.Bolsonaro also served more than 100 days under house arrest in Brasilia while facing charges that he solicited Trump’s interference on his behalf.Emotionally destroyed, son saysCongressman Eduardo Bolsonaro, the former president’s son, told Reuters in his first comments to the media on Tuesday that Bolsonaro’s prosecution was “psychological torture” and a “rigged game.”Another Bolsonaro son, Carlos, said after visiting his father in custody on Tuesday: “He is emotionally destroyed.”Although Bolsonaro insists he will run for president again next year, he and his family are also working to preserve influence within Brazil’s right‐wing politics and shape the choice of an alternative conservative candidate in 2026.This has stirred impatience among allies who want to build an effective challenge in 2026 to Lula.He holds a lead in polls over all potential right-wing candidates, and his approval ratings climbed again in a poll on Tuesday.But Bolsonaro’s defence in his ankle-monitor tampering case that he was impaired by prescription drugs fueled doubts about his political viability.He said the medication led him to believe the ankle monitor concealed listening equipment.“Until recently, Bolsonaro often boasted about being an athlete,” said Pedro Fassoni Arruda, a political science professor at the Pontifical Catholic University of Sao Paulo who noted declining public support for Bolsonaro in polls.“Now he presents himself as someone frail and ageing.”In contrast to the mobs he spurred to storm Congress in 2023, only a handful of his supporters gathered outside the Federal Police building where Bolsonaro was being held on Tuesday.Trump on Saturday said Bolsonaro’s detention was “too bad,” in a jarring change of tone after months of pressuring Brazilian courts to drop the case against the former president.Still, Bolsonaro’s closest allies insist he remains potent.“He is not politically weakened,” said right-wing Senator Damares Alves. “He is simply showing what we have long said: His health is not well.”"

Israel says it has received another set of human remains from militants in Gaza,"DEIR AL-BALAH, Gaza Strip — Israel on Tuesday said it received human remains turned over by Palestinian militants and forensic experts were trying to determine if they belonged to one of the three remaining hostages held in Gaza.The handover was the latest under a fragile ceasefire that began in October and has held despite accusations by both sides of violations.The Palestinian militant group Islamic Jihad said it found the remains earlier this week in Nuseirat, a refugee camp in central Gaza.The ceasefire requires Hamas to release all hostages, and Palestinian militants have returned 25 hostage bodies so far. The remaining hostages are two Israelis and a man from Thailand. In return, Israel has released the bodies of 330 Palestinians to Gaza. Most remain unidentified.Israel has accused Hamas of stalling and threatened to resume military operations or withhold humanitarian aid if all remains are not returned. Hamas says it has not been able to reach all the remains of hostages because they are buried under rubble from Israel’s two-year offensive.Netanyahu’s office asserted that the delay amounted to a ceasefire violation.A rising death toll in GazaWhile daily fighting has stopped, the death toll has gone up as Israel strikes parts of Gaza in response to what it says are ceasefire violations by Hamas.Gaza's health ministry on Tuesday said Israeli forces killed three people east of Khan Younis in the south. It said the bodies were brought to hospitals along with 14 others recovered from the rubble over the past 24 hours. Those brought the death toll to 345 Palestinians since the ceasefire took effect, the ministry said.On Tuesday night, Israel's military said it killed five militants emerging from a tunnel in Rafah in southern Gaza and another who crossed into an Israeli-held part of northern Gaza and approached troops.The war began with the Hamas-led attack on southern Israel on Oct. 7, 2023, that killed some 1,200 people and took over 250 hostages. Almost all of the hostages or their remains have been returned in ceasefires or other deals.Gaza’s Health Ministry says 69,775 Palestinians have been killed and 170,863 injured in Israel’s retaliatory offensive. It does not distinguish between civilians and combatants in its figures, but has said women and children make up a majority of those killed. The ministry is staffed by medical professionals and maintains detailed records viewed as generally reliable by independent experts.Meanwhile, families in Gaza confronted heavy winter rains that worsened dire humanitarian conditions for many of the 2 million people displaced by the war.Planning for Gaza stabilization forcePlanning was underway for an international stabilization force mandated by the UN last week during the approval of Washington's 20-point blueprint to secure and govern Gaza.Indonesia said Tuesday it was preparing troops. Officials said the final deployment would await an official order from Indonesian President Prabowo Subianto, who has said his country was ready to deploy 20,000 peacekeepers to Gaza at any time.Gen. Agus Subianto, chief of the Indonesian Armed Forces, told reporters the contingent would be a brigade consisting of health, engineering and mechanized support battalions, and that the military was preparing other support, including three hospital warships, a C-130 Hercules military transport aircraft and a helicopter.The U.S. plan also includes a transitional authority to be overseen by President Donald Trump and envisions a possible future path to an independent Palestinian state.Seeking visits for detained PalestiniansIsraeli human rights organizations HaMoked, the Association for Civil Rights in Israel and the Public Committee Against Torture in Israel filed a petition on Tuesday to Israel's high court calling on authorities to resume family visits for Palestinian prisoners suspected of being militants.Family visits were suspended at the beginning of the war in Gaza. Since then, the number of Palestinians dying in Israeli custody has surged, and prison populations have doubled. Rights groups allege systematic violence and denial of medical care as key causes of deaths.HaMoked attorney Daniel Shenhar said “Israel has almost completely cut off Palestinian prisoners and detainees from the outside world.”A popemobile for GazaThe Catholic charity Caritas on Tuesday unveiled the late Pope Francis’ so-called popemobile in the Israeli-occupied West Bank. Per Francis’ request, it has been transformed into a mobile health clinic and is supposed to be sent to Gaza to help care for children.“This vehicle stands as a testament. The world has not forgotten the children of Gaza,” said Cardinal Anders Arborelius, the bishop of Stockholm, Sweden."

FBI seeks interviews with Democrats who urged US troops to defy illegal orders,"WASHINGTON, D.C. — Democratic lawmakers who appeared in a social media video urging US troops to defy “illegal orders” say the FBI has contacted them to begin scheduling interviews, signaling a possible inquiry into the matter.It would mark the second investigation tied to the video, coming a day after the Pentagon said it was reviewing Democratic Sen. Mark Kelly of Arizona over potential violations of military law. The FBI and Pentagon actions come after President Donald Trump accused the lawmakers of sedition and said it is “punishable by DEATH” in a social media post.Together, the inquiries mark an extraordinary escalation for federal law enforcement and military institutions that traditionally steer clear of partisan clashes. They also underscore the administration’s willingness to push legal limits against its critics, even when they are sitting members of Congress. Lawmakers in the video urge troops to reject any illegal orders from their superiors, something they are already duty-bound to do.“President Trump is using the FBI as a tool to intimidate and harass Members of Congress,” a group of four Democratic House members said in a statement Tuesday. “Yesterday, the FBI contacted the House and Senate Sergeants at Arms requesting interviews.”Democrats call inquiry a ‘scare tactic’Michigan Sen. Elissa Slotkin, one of the six Democratic lawmakers in the video, told reporters Tuesday that “last night the counterterrorism division at the FBI sent a note to the members of Congress, saying they are opening what appears to be an inquiry against the six of us.” Slotkin called it a “scare tactic by” Trump.“Whether you agree with the video or don’t agree with the video, the question to me is: is this the appropriate response for a president of the United States to go after and seek to weaponize the federal government against those he disagrees with?” said Slotkin.The group of four Democratic House members said in their statement that “no amount of intimidation or harassment will ever stop us from doing our jobs and honoring our Constitution.”All six of the Democratic lawmakers in the video have served in the military or intelligence community.Republican Sen. Lisa Murkowski of Alaska criticized both inquiries on social media, saying that accusing the lawmakers “of treason and sedition for rightfully pointing out that servicemembers can refuse illegal orders is reckless and flat-out wrong.”“The Department of Defense and FBI surely have more important priorities than this frivolous investigation,” wrote Murkowski.FBI provides no insight into interview requestsThe FBI went through the top security officials for the House and Senate to request interviews with each of the six lawmakers. The lawmakers said they had no further information and the FBI has not made clear on what basis they were seeking the interviews.The FBI declined to comment Tuesday, but Director Kash Patel, in an interview with journalist Catherine Herridge, described it as an “ongoing matter” in explaining why he could not discuss details.Asked for his reaction to the video, Patel said, “What goes through my head is the same thing that goes through my head in any case: is there a lawful predicate to open up an inquiry and investigation, or is there not? And that decision will be made by the career agents and analysts here at the FBI.”The video at the heart of the inquiriesIn the video, lawmakers said they needed troops to “stand up for our laws ... our Constitution.” Kelly, who was a fighter pilot before becoming an astronaut and then retiring at the rank of captain, told troops that “you can refuse illegal orders.”After the Pentagon announced the investigation into Kelly on Monday, Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth referred it to the Navy on Tuesday and requested a briefing by Dec. 10.The lawmakers didn’t mention specific circumstances in the video. But at an event Tuesday in Michigan, Slotkin pointed to the Trump administration ordering the military to blow up small boats in the Caribbean Sea and eastern Pacific Ocean accused of ferrying drugs and continued attempts at deploying National Guard troops into U.S. cities despite some legal setbacks.“It wasn’t that there was any one incident, it was the sheer number of people coming to us and saying, ‘I’m worried. I am being sent to Washington or I’m being sent to LA or Chicago, North Carolina now, and I’m concerned I’m going to be asked to do something that I don’t know if I should do,'” said Slotkin. “So that’s where it came from.”Troops, especially uniformed commanders, do have specific obligations to reject orders that are unlawful, if they make that determination.Broad legal precedence also holds that just following orders — colloquially known as the “Nuremberg defense,” as it was used unsuccessfully by senior Nazi officials to justify their actions under Adolf Hitler — doesn’t absolve troops."

DOJ blames DHS Secretary Noem for controversial deportations despite court order: report,"The Justice Department confirmed Tuesday that it was Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem who authorized the deportation of 100 Venezuelan men to a notorious El Salvador prison in March, despite a federal judge’s order to keep them in U.S. custody, according to a new Politico report.The disclosure came tucked into a response to U.S. District Judge James Boasberg’s demands that the Trump administration identify the officials responsible for the unprecedented deportation operation. Boasberg is now resuming his bid to hold officials in contempt after an appeals court temporarily halted proceedings, according to the outlet.“Noem’s call ensured that the deportees — rounded up and expelled with virtual no due process after President Donald Trump invoked war powers to designate them as members of a transnational gang — would remain imprisoned in El Salvador under harsh conditions for months, until the U.S. helped broker a prisoner swap that resulted in all of the men being returned to Venezuela,” Politico reported Tuesday. Lawyers for the men, backed by Boasberg, had scrambled to halt the deportations, but Noem’s decision sealed their fate.Justice Department officials said Noem acted based on legal guidance from top DOJ officials, including Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche and then-Principal Associate Deputy Attorney General Emil Bove, as well as DHS lawyers. That advice argued that Boasberg’s oral and subsequent written orders were ineffective once flights had left U.S. airspace.“After receiving that legal advice, Secretary Noem directed that the AEA detainees who had been removed from the United States before the Court’s order could be transferred to the custody of El Salvador,” Justice Department attorney Tiberius Davis wrote in the new court filing obtained by Politico, referencing Alien Enemies Act detainees. “That decision was lawful and was consistent with a reasonable interpretation of the Court’s order.”The judge made clear Tuesday that he intends to uncover the full chain of decisions that led to the controversial mass deportations. “I certainly intend to find out what happened that day,” Boasberg said, “and the government can assist me to whatever degree it wishes.”NEW: DOJ said tonight that it was DHS Secretary Kristi Noem who made the call to proceed with the deportation of more than 100 Venezuelan men to El Salvador, despite a judge's order seeking to block the transfer. w/ @joshgerstein https://t.co/4lpHxX3p7m pic.twitter.com/XvG5b7As8V— Kyle Cheney (@kyledcheney) November 26, 2025"

Health care plan circulated by the White House runs into familiar GOP divisions,"WASHINGTON, D.C. — A health care proposal circulated by the White House in recent days is running into the reality of Republican divisions on the issue — a familiar struggle for a party that has been trying to scrap or overhaul the Affordable Care Act for the past 15 years.The tentative proposal from President Donald Trump would extend expiring ACA subsidies for two years while adjusting eligibility requirements for recipients. The plan has so far been met with a stony silence on Capitol Hill as Republicans debate among themselves whether to overhaul the law, tweak it or simply let the subsidies expire.It’s unclear now when the White House plan might be released, or if it will be released at all.The Republican indecision comes as the COVID-era tax credits are set to expire Jan. 1, creating sharp premium increases for millions of Americans. Democrats who shut down the government for six weeks over the issue are demanding a straight extension with no changes, though some indicated they could support a plan similar to the one circulated by the White House.But support may be harder to find in the GOP conference, where many lawmakers say costs are still too high and have been eager to make another run at repealing the ACA. The last effort in 2017 failed when Republicans couldn’t decide on how to provide coverage to millions of Americans who depend on government-run marketplaces for their health care. It's a dilemma that persists for the party after record numbers signed up for coverage this year.Senate Majority Leader John Thune, R-S.D., promised a group of moderate Democrats a vote on the ACA tax credits by mid-December in exchange for their votes to end the government shutdown. But it’s unclear, so far, whether that arrangement will lead to a solution.Bipartisan compromise?Health care has long been one of the most politically fraught topics on Capitol Hill, so a bipartisan compromise seems unlikely. But the coming price spikes have motivated some lawmakers to look for points of agreement.Republican Sen. Thom Tillis of North Carolina said last week that he hopes the subsidies are extended.“I’m sure some of my colleagues will be mad at me for saying this — if we don’t address the subsidies issue in December, I don’t think it’s going to get addressed next year,” Tillis said, adding that Democratic campaigns will be “just churning up all the very sympathetic stories” if it isn't fixed.The draft White House proposal would put new income limits on the tax credits — at 700 percent of the federal poverty level, according to two people with knowledge of the proposal who requested anonymity to discuss it. The White House would also require those on Obamacare, regardless of the type of coverage, to pay some sort of premium for their plans. That would effectively end zero-premium plans for those with lower incomes, addressing a concern from Republicans who say the program has enabled fraud.Some Democrats have suggested they are open to those ideas as a part of broader negotiations. “I’m glad the president is reportedly considering a serious proposal,” said New Hampshire Sen. Jeanne Shaheen, one of the Democrats who voted to end the shutdown.Some Republicans have signaled support as well. Nebraska Rep. Mike Flood, the chairman of the business-oriented Republican Main Street Caucus, said in a statement that the group supports “President Trump’s ongoing efforts to address the ACA tax credit cliff with an extension.”Several bipartisan bills in the House would extend the ACA credits for two years, with changes such as income limits for the enhanced credit. “I think two years is really the sweet spot where everybody is OK,” said Pennsylvania Rep. Brian Fitzpatrick, a co-chair of the bipartisan Problem Solvers Caucus.Premium spikes on Jan. 1Still, House Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., has declined to say whether he will allow a vote on a health care bill. Many other members of his GOP conference want to see the subsidies eliminated or the underlying law overhauled. In addition, Thune and other Republicans have said they want new language on abortion restrictions if they pass an extension — a dealbreaker for Democrats.If Congress doesn’t act, the enhanced premium tax credits that have helped many Americans pay for Affordable Care Act health insurance plans will disappear. And premiums could more than double for subsidized enrollees, according to an analysis by the health care research nonprofit KFF.Signups for next year’s insurance began on Nov. 1, meaning that many Americans are already planning for the higher costs. Democrats who forced the shutdown at the beginning of October had hoped to negotiate an extension before open enrollment began.“When people’s monthly payments spike next year, they will know it was Republicans that made it happen,” Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer said last week.Republicans could go at it aloneAs Democrats elevated the health care issue during the shutdown, some Republicans saw an opportunity to renew their efforts to overhaul the law. GOP lawmakers in the House and Senate have been meeting to find consensus, though they haven't found it yet.Among the GOP ideas are separate proposals from Florida Sen. Rick Scott and Louisiana Sen. Bill Cassidy to use savings accounts to either shop for insurance or defray out-of-pocket costs. Scott’s legislation would create what he called “Trump Health Freedom Accounts” and make some changes to the health care law, including by allowing consumers to shop across state lines. Cassidy’s narrower bill would create new savings accounts just to replace the enhanced subsidies that are expiring.The draft of the White House plan, meanwhile, would allow those in lower-tier plans, such as the bronze-level or catastrophic plans, to put money into health savings accounts.Those proposals are unlikely to win over Democrats. Schumer said last week that the savings accounts “will go nowhere in the Senate.”Skeptical that the two parties will ever agree, some Republicans have suggested that they try to pass a health care package using budget maneuvers similar to Trump’s “ Big Beautiful Bill ” of tax and spending cuts. If it worked, they could pass the legislation with zero Democratic votes — a politically risky strategy that could take months, well into the midterm election year.It all depends on TrumpSome Republicans may be waiting for clear direction from Trump, who has been sending mixed signals about what he wants.For several weeks, Trump appeared to be backing the savings accounts on social media, posting as recently as Nov. 18 that “THE ONLY HEALTHCARE I WILL SUPPORT OR APPROVE IS SENDING THE MONEY DIRECTLY BACK TO THE PEOPLE, WITH NOTHING GOING TO THE BIG, FAT, RICH INSURANCE COMPANIES, WHO HAVE MADE $TRILLIONS, AND RIPPED OFF AMERICA LONG ENOUGH.”He added: “Congress, do not waste your time and energy on anything else.”Trump reiterated that message Tuesday evening.“Don’t give the money to the insurance companies,” he told reporters Tuesday evening. ""You give the money to the people.”"

"Fed politicization, “Hassett effect” a potential shadow on the USD","The U.S. dollar weakened after markets sharply increased the odds of Kevin Hassett being nominated as the next Federal Reserve chair, according to Mizuho Securities. Said traders are not questioning the Fed’s independence based on policy signals alone, with senior officials including John Williams, Chris Waller and Mary Daly all openly supporting another cut next month.However, analysts noted that investors are starting to price in the risk that a Hassett nomination could politicize the central bank, a dynamic they dubbed the “Hassett effect.” This perception, they said, weighs on the dollar by raising concerns about future policy direction and the possibility of a more politically compliant Fed. Until these doubts fade, he warned, the threat of dollar “debasement” will remain elevated.

Talking turkey: Trump turns pardon ritual into political roast,"Talking turkey: Trump turns pardon ritual into political roastEstelle.BronkhorstWed, 11/26/2025 - 06:00 WASHINGTON - Donald Trump turned Washington's fluffiest tradition into something a little tougher to carve, swapping holiday cheer for political score-settling as he pardoned two turkeys in the annual White House Thanksgiving ceremony.Since Abraham Lincoln's day, presidents have occasionally spared a lucky bird from becoming dinner, though the ceremony didn't become a yearly tradition until John F. Kennedy made it official in 1963.This year's feathered VIPs -- Waddle and Gobble of North Carolina -- were meant to be the stars of a festive, bipartisan moment.But the Hallmark-card episode quickly turned into a holiday roast as Trump tore into Democrats, fumed about crime and even revived a conspiracy theory about Joe Biden's pardoning process.Waddle was absent for reasons that were not immediately clear but Gobble showed up -- and appeared grateful not to get cooked alongside Trump's many targets.The president focused on Chicago, declaring once again that he could clean up crime in America's third-largest city if only Illinois Governor JB Pritzker -- whom he branded a ""fat slob"" -- would let him send in federal troops.Then came the Biden hit: Trump said US officials conducted a ""very rigorous investigation"" and discovered that last year's turkey pardon was signed not by the then-president but by an autopen -- rendering the whole thing invalid.Even the birds weren't safe from becoming political props. Trump mused aloud about naming Waddle and Gobble after Democratic leaders Chuck Schumer and Nancy Pelosi -- before stopping himself. ""I realised I wouldn't be pardoning them. I would never pardon those two people,"" he remarked acidly.He then pivoted to economics, delivering a burst of cherry-picked statistics. ""Egg prices are down 86 percent since March,"" he declared. ""And gasoline will soon be hovering around $2 a gallon."" He also boasted he had delivered the largest tax cuts in history.While egg prices have indeed fallen from their record highs, grocery costs overall are still rising. The national average for gasoline sits at $3.10 -- slightly higher than this time last year, according to automotive services group AAA. And the One Big Beautiful Bill Act -- which extends provisions of Trump's 2017 tax law -- ranks around the sixth-largest tax cut ever, not the biggest.As for Gobble, the bird carried on with remarkable composure for a turkey caught in the spotlight at a de facto campaign rally.The fowl were selected by North Carolina students in an online vote and will now retire to a comfortable post-pardon life back home."
Brazil's Bolsonaro begins 27-year jail term for coup bid,"Brazil's Bolsonaro begins 27-year jail term for coup bidEstelle.BronkhorstWed, 11/26/2025 - 06:00 BRASILIA - Brazil's Supreme Court on Tuesday ordered far-right former president Jair Bolsonaro to begin serving a 27-year sentence for plotting a failed coup, after he exhausted all appeals.The brash former army captain who fired up Brazil's right and reshaped the country's politics is ending a divisive career jailed in a small room at police headquarters equipped with a TV, mini-fridge, and air-conditioning.Bolsonaro was convicted in September over a scheme to stop Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva from taking office as president after the 2022 elections that included a plot to kill the veteran leftist.Prosecutors said the scheme failed only due to a lack of support from military top brass.The Supreme Court rejected an appeal to his sentence earlier this month, and on Tuesday ruled the judgment was now final.The court also ordered a military tribunal to decide whether Bolsonaro should be stripped of his captain's rank.Bolsonaro had been under house arrest until Saturday, when he was detained at police headquarters in the capital Brasilia for tampering with his ankle monitor using a soldering iron.Supreme Court Justice Alexandre de Moraes said there were signs Bolsonaro was planning to flee during a planned vigil organized by his son outside his home.The justice pointed to the location of the nearby US embassy, and Bolsonaro's close relationship with US President Donald Trump, suggesting he may have tried to escape to seek political asylum.Bolsonaro said he had acted from ""paranoia"" induced by medications he was on and denied trying to escape.The court ruled Bolsonaro will remain detained in the officers' room -- a secure space for protected prisoners -- where he is currently held in Brasilia.Five of Bolsonaro's co-accused, including military generals and former ministers, also began serving sentences Tuesday of between 19 and 26 years.His former intelligence chief Alexandre Ramagem, who was sentenced to 16 years in prison, was declared a fugitive after recently fleeing to the United States.Bolsonaro's defense lawyer Paulo Cunha Bueno said the closure of the case was ""surprising"" and that he would file an appeal anyway.- 'Extremely fragile' - AFP | Evaristo Sa Bolsonaro is the fourth former president to be imprisoned since the end of the military dictatorship in 1985.In May, Fernando Collor de Mello was allowed to serve his nearly nine-year sentence for corruption at home, on health grounds.Bolsonaro's defense team wants him to be afforded the same treatment, saying his detention is putting his life at risk.Bolsonaro suffers the consequences of a stab wound to the abdomen during a 2018 campaign trail attack and has required several follow-up surgeries.He also suffers from persistent ""uncontrollable hiccups"" linked to gastric issues that have left him out of breath and fainting, according to his doctors.Bolsonaro's family has sought to spotlight the poor mental and physical state of the far-right firebrand who drew criticism during his presidency for attacks on minorities and a lack of empathy for those dying from Covid.After a visit to his father on Tuesday, Carlos Bolsonaro described him as ""extremely fragile and psychologically devastated.""""He's eating very little -- there's no way for someone who knows he didn't commit a crime to see this as normal.""Bolsonaro, who was president from 2019 to 2022, maintains that he is innocent and a victim of political persecution.With Bolsonaro out of the running, Brazil's large conservative electorate is without a champion heading into 2026 presidential elections, in which Lula, 80, has said he will seek a fourth term.Lula himself spent time in jail in between presidential mandates for corruption. He was imprisoned for a year and a half before the Supreme Court overturned his conviction.by Juan Sebastian SerranoThe information contained in the article posted represents the views and opinions of the author and does not necessarily represent the views or opinions of eNCA.com."

Operating without warrants or identification and prepared to arrest bystanders whom they deem to be interfering, ICE personnel have brought into reality a scenario that until now would have been dismissed as fantasy — or at least as something that could never happen here. Standard ICE procedures aren’t just frightening people of Latino origin or people who look as if they might be Latino.

Brazilian Ex-President Bolsonaro Placed In 12-sq Meter Jail Cell To Begin Sentence,"Brazilian Ex-President Bolsonaro Placed In 12-sq Meter Jail Cell To Begin Sentence Brazil's former president, Jair Bolsonaro, has been ordered by the country's supreme court to start serving his 27-year sentence, even as what could be a very lengthy further appeals effort carries on.He was convicted in September for plotting a coup, based on allegations he also cooperated with foreign influence, for not accepting the election results which brough President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva to power. Bolsonaro, who only somewhat recently was living in Florida after which he returned to his home country to face and attempt to fight the charges, will reportedly begin this jail sentence in a 12 square meter room at a police base in the capital Brasilia.Supreme court justice Alexandre de Moraes ordered him directly to jail after over the weekend police raided his home, where he was on house arrest, when it was learned he attempted to remove his ankle monitor, which showed signs of damage from a soldering iron.AFP/Getty ImagesOthers among his top officials and supporters are also expected to begin serving out their sentences, reports The Guardian: Bolsonaro’s six co-conspirators were also ordered to start their sentences.The former defense minister Gen Paulo Sérgio Nogueira de Oliveira, and the former minister for institutional security Gen Augusto Heleno were arrested and imprisoned in the Planalto Military Command in Brasília. They received sentences of 19 and 21 years respectively.The former navy commander Adm Almir Garnier Santos, who received a 24-year sentence, was reportedly arrested by navy officials and held on a navy base.Bolsonaro’s former defence minister, Gen Walter Braga Netto, who received a 26-year sentence, was already in custody having been arrested last December.The former justice minister, Anderson Torres, who received a 24-year sentence, was expected to be sent to a penitentiary for police officers and other “special” prisoners in Brasília called Papudinha.Still, the start of these jail terms could result in large-scale protests among what is still a significant pro-Bolsonaro base:“He’s been kidnapped,” complained Ronny de Souza, a 43-year-old Bolsonaro activist, as he stood outside the federal police base where the politician was taken last weekend after being arrested amid suspicions he was about to abscond to a foreign embassy.We detailed Saturday that federal police rushed to his residence to take him out of house arrest, and initiated what's being called a 'preventative arrest' - and he was whisked away to police headquarters in Brasilia. The arrest order issued from the country's top court came hours after his ankle monitor was shown to be violated at 12:08am on Saturday. From there, authorities considered Bolsonaro a flight risk, explaining he is in close proximity to foreign embassies where he might try and gain asylum.Photos released by the court show the ankle monitor's cap heavily damaged, after he reportedly at one point took a soldering iron to it. According to The New York Times:At first, Mr. Bolsonaro told the police that he had banged his ankle monitor causing it to malfunction, according to a report from the capital region’s prison authority.But when an agent on the scene asked about the burn marks on the device, Mr. Bolsonaro admitted using a soldering iron to try to melt it. In a video of the exchange released by the authorities, Mr. Bolsonaro can be heard apparently telling the agent that he had started torching the monitor hours earlier.His legal team has since claimed that ""Bolsonaro would have no way of escaping"" as he is ""an elderly man who suffers from serious health problems.Trump reacts, but merely says ""that's too bad""...Hear me out: TRUMP WAS IN ON BOLSONARO’S ESCAPE PLAN.Bolsonaro spoke with him before getting arrested for tampering with his ankle monitor. Here is Trump saying he expected to meet him “in the near future” and was stunned he ended up back in jail.#Maddow pic.twitter.com/2xCBcX7ptg— Canada Hates Trump (@AntiTrumpCanada) November 25, 2025However, Justice Alexandre de Moraes, who has long been a political enemy (the US has even sanctioned him personally) as well as chief overseer of the case, described over the weekend, ""He is located about 13 kilometers (8 miles) away from where the United States of America embassy lies, in a distance that can be covered in a 15-minute drive.""

And a Ukrainian official said the new version was ""significantly better.""However, US officials acknowledged that ""delicate"" issues remain.And French President Emmanuel Macron threw cold water on the idea of a rapid solution, stating that there is ""clearly no Russian willingness"" for a ceasefire or to discuss the new, more Ukraine-friendly proposal.Frantic discussions have been underway since the weekend when Ukrainian and US representatives huddled in Geneva to discuss Trump's controversial, initial 28-point plan for settling the bloody conflict.Latest talks including US and Russian delegates were taking place in Abu Dhabi, US media reported.

Oil stabilises after Ukraine peace talks push prices to one-month lows,"BEIJING: Oil prices recovered slightly on Wednesday, after dipping to one-month lows in the previous session amid signs that Ukraine is nearing a peace deal with Russia that would likely lead to the end of international sanctions on Russian supply.Brent crude futures rose 19 cents, or 0.3%, to $62.67 a barrel as of 0114 GMT, while U.S. West Texas Intermediate crude futures gained 14 cents, or 0.24%, to $58.09 a barrel.Both contracts settled down 89 cents on Tuesday after Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy told European leaders in a speech that he was ready to advance a U.S.-backed framework for ending the war with Russia and that only a few points of disagreement remained.“If finalised, the deal could rapidly dismantle Western sanctions on Russian energy exports,” potentially driving WTI prices to around $55, IG market analyst Tony Sycamore said in a client note.“For now, the market waits for more clarity, but the risk appears to be for lower prices unless talks falter.”U.S. President Donald Trump said he has directed his representatives to meet separately with Russian President Vladimir Putin and Ukrainian officials, while a Ukrainian official said Zelenskiy could visit the U.S. in the next few days to finalise a deal with Trump.Britain, Europe and the United States have tightened sanctions on Russia recently in a stepped-up pressure campaign, and Russian oil purchases by key buyer India are set to hit their lowest level in three years in December.Offering some support to crude prices, expectations have risen for a potential U.S. Federal Reserve interest rate cut in December following economic data releases showing lower retail spending and softer inflation. Lower rates would stimulate economic growth and bolster demand for oil."

‘Love to see that happen’: MAGA attorney floats military raid to free Tina Peters,"Tina Peters’ attorney is now openly floating the idea that President Donald Trump should use the U.S. military to break the convicted Colorado election denier out of state prison – the latest escalation in a wave of far-right rhetoric surrounding her case.The comments came during a recent appearance on MAGA influencer Steve Bannon’s War Room podcast, when attorney Peter Tickton was asked whether he believed Trump should dispatch the 101st Airborne Division to Peters’ Colorado facility to forcibly remove her. Tickton didn’t hesitate. “Do I think it should be done? For who I am, yeah – I’d love to see that happen,” Tickton replied.Peters, the former Mesa County clerk convicted last year in a scheme to undermine the 2020 election, is serving a nine-year sentence for tampering with election equipment in 2021 after breaching voting machines. Her imprisonment has become a rallying point for MAGA activists, with Trump calling her a “political prisoner” and demanding her immediate release earlier this year.The attorney’s wild military raid idea comes as a bipartisan group of Colorado county clerks issued a rare joint statement urging Republican Gov. Jared Polis to keep Peters in state custody, following reports that federal officials have sought to have her transferred to the federal prison system. Meanwhile, rhetoric from Peters’ allies continues to intensify, according to a 9News KUSA report by Denver journalist Kyle Clark. He reported that MAGA podcaster Joe Oltmann, an influential figure in Colorado’s far-right circles and a Peters ally, went further this week, calling for the execution of Polis and other state officials for their handling of the Peters case, saying they should “hang by their neck until dead.”Polis has not said whether he plans to hand Peters over to federal authorities, but has agreed to meet with the clerks following their public plea."

Recap: Trump drops deadline 4 Ukraine peace deal as U.S. seeks rapid agreement with Russia,"President Donald Trump has walked back his earlier insistence that Ukraine agree to a U.S.-backed peace plan by Thanksgiving, saying there is no firm deadline for a deal and that “the deadline for me is when it’s over.”Speaking to reporters aboard Air Force One en route to Florida for the Thanksgiving break, Trump said U.S. negotiators were making headway in talks with both Kyiv and Moscow, and that Russia had agreed to certain concessions — though he declined to specify what they were.The emerging U.S. framework for ending the conflict, reported last week, has raised concern that Washington may be pressuring Ukraine into terms that favour Moscow. Trump confirmed that his envoy, Steve Witkoff, will travel to Moscow soon to meet President Vladimir Putin. He also said Jared Kushner, who helped broker the Gaza ceasefire, is involved in the negotiations.Trump had previously floated Thursday as the date he wanted an agreement in place, but both he and senior officials have since softened the stance, saying they simply aim for a deal “as soon as possible.”The president also suggested Russia currently holds a battlefield advantage and warned that Ukraine risks losing additional territory in the coming months. He said talks were underway with European partners on potential security guarantees for Kyiv as part of any settlement. This article was written by Eamonn Sheridan at investinglive.com."

Thomas Pellerin-Carlin, an MEP from the Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats, delivered a fiery rebuke, accusing European leaders of underestimating Vladimir Putin and overestimating U.S. reliability. He warned that Europe is now “caught between two brutes” and must become strategically self-reliant to defend its interests. Countering that view, Hans Neuhoff, an MEP from the Europe of Sovereign Nations group, argued that Western assumptions about Russia’s intentions are misguided. He claimed that Moscow never intended to control all of Ukraine, pointing to the initial size of its invasion force, and insisted Russia merely seeks a neutral status for Ukraine, similar to pre-2014.

Japan Launches DOGE-Like Initiative To Cut Government Waste,"Japan Launches DOGE-Like Initiative To Cut Government Waste Authored by Victoria Friedman via The Epoch Times,Japan’s finance minister on Nov. 25 unveiled a plan to cut wasteful government spending, drawing parallels to the United States’ Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE).Japanese Finance Minister Satsuki Katayama arrives at the prime minister's official residence in Tokyo, on Oct. 21, 2025. Kim Kyung Hoon/ReutersFinance Minister Satsuki Katayama launched the “Office for Administrative Reform and Promotion of Efficiency,” which she said will work with the finance and internal affairs ministries to review measures such as government subsidies and special tax treatments for companies, according to The Japan Times.“The public requires the government to show a constant commitment to maintain fiscal sustainability. It is crucial that this commitment is always present in Kasumigaseki and Nagatacho,” Katayama said during a press conference, referring, respectively, to Japan’s government district and where its parliament—the Diet—is located.Katayama sought to distinguish Japan’s office for reform from the U.S.’s efficiency agency, saying, “Unlike DOGE, we’re not aiming to overhaul government organizations,” but rather on reviewing how taxpayers’ money is spent.“To maintain trust in the sustainability of Japan’s finances, it’s very important to show the public how we are always looking into how we spend,” she said.DOGE’s $214 Billion in SavingsU.S. President Donald Trump established DOGE in January as a task force designed to root out fraud, waste, and abuse from the federal government. It is due to expire on July 4, 2026.In its latest contracts update from Nov. 23, DOGE wrote in a post on X that Federal government agencies terminated and reduced 78 “wasteful” contracts over the previous nine days, with a ceiling value of $1.9 billion, generating $335 million in savings.Among the terminated contracts was a $4.3 million IT services contract for “Inflation Reduction Act transformation project management support” at the IRS, a $661,000 Department of Health & Human Services (HHS) IT services contract for “social media monitoring platform subscription,” and a $191,000 U.S. Agency for Global Media contract for “broadcast operations and maintenance in Ethiopia, Africa.”The HHS ranked at the top of agencies with the most savings under DOGE, followed by the General Services Administration, the Social Security Administration, the Office of Personnel Management, and the Small Business Administration, according to DOGE’s Agency Efficiency Leaderboard.Tesla CEO Elon Musk shakes hands with President Donald Trump as they speak to reporters in the Oval Office of the White House in Washington on May 30, 2025. Kevin Dietsch/Getty ImagesAccording to the DOGE website, the initiative has generated total savings of $214 billion as of Oct. 4, which amounts to more than $1,329 per taxpayer.The savings were achieved through measures such as asset sales, interest savings, workforce reductions, regulatory savings, deletion of fraud and improper payments, and cancellation or renegotiation of contracts/leases, according to the website.Musk’s DepartureDOGE was headed by Elon Musk until he left the department earlier this year when his 130-day tenure as a special government employee expired.Musk and Trump appeared in the Oval Office on May 30 to answer questions before his departure, during which the president credited the tech entrepreneur with “a colossal change in the old ways of doing business in Washington.”After accepting a ceremonial key from the president, Musk said: “I think the DOGE team is doing an incredible job. They’re going to continue to be doing an incredible job.”Trump praised Musk’s work, saying he led the “most sweeping and consequential government reform effort in generations.” Tyler DurdenTue, 11/25/2025 - 21:45"

WSJ slams Trump for pardoning man who illegally voted for him twice,"When President Donald Trump issued pardons to numerous Republican Party officials, lawyers and activists who tried to help him overturn the results of the 2020 presidential election, he also may have inadvertently included one man who committed voter fraud on his behalf. Now, the Wall Street Journal (WSJ) editorial board is questioning the implications of that defendant's accepting of the pardon.On Tuesday, the paper said Trump's pardons suggest he has ""thrown legal caution to the wind,"" and warned him that those winds ""can blow in unexpected directions."" The WSJ compared Trump to former President Joe Biden in labeling his his pardons as ""capacious and unconditional.""The conservative editorial board noted that Trump had ""no power"" to dismiss most of those cases, which are being handled by various state officials, making the pardons ""symbolic."" And while the pardons were largely for members of his legal team like former New York City Mayor Rudi Giuliani and attorneys like John Eastman and Sidney Powell, one of the people who indirectly received a pardon in an ongoing federal case is Matthew Laiss.As Votebeat reported, Laiss moved from Pennsylvania to Florida in August of 2020 and cast ballots for Trump in both states, voting in-person in Florida and casting a mail-in ballot in Bucks County, Pennsylvania. Laiss' attorney has argued that because Trump's clemency announcement grants ""a full, complete, and unconditional pardon to all United States citizens"" for 2020 election misconduct, Laiss qualifies for the pardon.""By its plain language, the pardon extends to Mr. Laiss,"" the man's attorney wrote in a court filing. ""He hereby accepts the pardon.""The U.S. Attorney's Office for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania charged Laiss with voter fraud, and he has pleaded not guilty. The Trump administration has until Friday to clarify whether its pardon extends to him. Federal prosecutors told the judge overseeing the case that it is currently ""consulting with Department of Justice [DOJ] attorneys in Washington, D.C."" about Laiss' case. The Journal predicted that other 2020 voter fraud defendants are likely paying close attention to how the DOJ responds.Click here to read the WSJ's editorial in full (subscription required)."

Democrats made the extension of the subsidies their critical issue in the federal government shutdown that dragged on for weeks.""The warning underscores the hurdles facing any deal in the coming weeks. Lawmakers have a mid-December deadline for healthcare votes promised as a condition for Democrats voting to end the government shutdown earlier this month. The enhanced subsidies expire at the end of the year, affecting more than 20 million people who benefit from the tax credits,"" said the report. ""On Tuesday night, Trump told reporters that he doesn’t support a two-year extension of the subsidies. 'I’d rather not extend them at all,' he said, adding that 'some kind of extension might be necessary to get something done.'""""The emerging White House plan would extend the subsidies temporarily, while imposing income caps for ACA enrollees to qualify, as well as measures to crack down on healthcare fraud, according to people familiar with the matter,"" said the report. ""Several Republicans want to pair the subsidy wind-down with the creation of health savings accounts, an approach Trump has praised.""Trump's plan was set to be revealed this week, but he punted at the last minute to give himself more time to work on it.A major sticking point has been abortion, according to the report. The ACA already prohibits federal funding from going to abortion coverage, but states and private insurers can fund that coverage separately if they wish; Republicans want to change the law so even that is illegal under any plan that receives ACA subsidies.Democrats have signaled that while they are open to income caps and anti-fraud measures, they draw a hard line against abortion restrictions — but many Republicans appear to be just as resolutely against any compromise that doesn't do so."

Trump backs ‘MAGA warrior’ accused of ‘misleading voters’ in military-themed ad,"President Donald Trump on Tuesday threw his “Complete and Total” support behind Republican Matt Van Epps, a Tennessee congressional candidate facing a complaint that accuses him of ""misleading voters"" by appearing in uniform in a recent campaign ad.In a post to his Truth Social platform Tuesday evening, Trump urged “all America First Patriots in Tennessee’s 7th Congressional District, who haven’t voted yet, to please GET OUT AND VOTE for MAGA Warrior Matt Van Epps” ahead of Wednesday’s final day of early in-person voting.“You can win this Election for Matt!” Trump wrote. “PLEASE VOTE FOR MATT VAN EPPS, who has my Complete and Total Endorsement.""The endorsement arrives as Van Epps, a Republican favorite who also scored the backing of Gov. Bill Lee (R-TN), faces scrutiny over a complaint filed last month involving the use of his U.S. Army uniform in one of his campaign ads. The complaint argues that Van Epps violated U.S. Department of War rules that bar military members from making political appearances in uniform or engaging in activity “that could reasonably give rise to the inference or appearance of official sponsorship, approval, or endorsement,” The Tennessean reported.Van Epps, a lieutenant colonel in the Tennessee National Guard and former Army helicopter pilot, appears in uniform throughout the ad, with patches and insignia removed, according to the Nashville-based publication. His campaign dismissed the allegations as “desperate nonsense.”But the complainant, Tennessee veteran Dillon Scott, argued that Van Epps is “improperly misleading voters about his military status” by “his flagrant flouting” of his uniform. He also called the ad “misleading and inappropriate” and “very disturbing” for someone seeking public office.The special election for the red state's Seventh Congressional District is set for Dec. 2."

Trinidad PM and senior US military official hold ‘excellent’ talks,"PORT OF SPAIN, Trinidad (CMC) – The chairman of the United States Joint Chiefs of Staff, General Dan Caine held talks on Tuesday with Trinidad Prime Minister Kamla Persad-Bissessar and members of her cabinet reaffirming the “strong partnership” between the two countries, discussing also “shared priorities for regional security and stability”.The US Embassy in Trinidad and Tobago had announced that the visit of Caine would “focus on the two nations’ strong bi-lateral relationship, strengthening regional stability, and regional unity on the vital importance of countering illicit trafficking and transnational criminal organisations”.Joint Staff spokesperson, Joseph Holstead, in a statement following the discussions said that Caine and Persad-Bissessar exchanged “views on challenges affecting the Caribbean region, including the destabilising effects of illicit narcotics, arms, and human trafficking, and transnational criminal organisation activities.”He said that the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff “emphasised that close cooperation between the United States and Trinidad and Tobago directly contributes to safeguarding regional security.“General Caine expressed appreciation for Trinidad and Tobago’s continued leadership and partnership in advancing mutual objectives and reaffirmed that the United States remains committed to working closely with Trinidad and Tobago to address shared threats and deepen collaboration across the Caribbean,” the spokesman added.In a statement posted on X, Prime Minister Persad-Bissessar described the talks as “excellent” saying that both Trinidad and Tobago and the North American country “continue to share a strong and enduring partnership”.Caine’s visit here comes as the United States President Donald Trump has ramped up its military presence in the Caribbean Sea ordering an amphibious squadron to the southern Caribbean as part of his effort to address threats from Latin American drug cartels.A nuclear-powered attack submarine, additional P8 Poseidon reconnaissance aircraft, several destroyers and a guided-missile cruiser have also been allocated to US Southern Command as part of the mission. In addition, the US largest carrier, the Gerald Forde has joined the build-upBut the United States military has been bombing vessels in the international waters claiming that the occupants were drug traffickers without offering any evidence of such activity.The United Nations UN High Commissioner for Human Rights also strongly condemned the airstrikes carried out by the United States against alleged drug trafficking boats in the Caribbean and Pacific.Volker Türk said in a statement that the strikes “violate international human rights law”, demanding that they be stopped immediately.On Tuesday, the Secretary General of the Organization of American States (OAS), Albert Ramdin, called on Venezuela and the United States not to use warfare as means of settling their differences, insisting that the hemisphere must remain a zone of peace.“I hope that both countries,Venezuela and the United States ...restrain themselves and make sure whatever other path can be found diplomatically, negotiations to solve their problems at a different level that should be..a priority.“We don’t want any war in our hemisphere. Peace in the end is what everybody in this hemisphere wants. Nobody gains from a war. So I think if we can achieve that and maintain at the same time this unity going forward on that consensus based agenda we possibly will end up after five or 10 years in a better environment...and prosperity in the Americas,” he added.Last month, the Guyana-based Caricom Secretariat said that regional leaders had discussed several issues on the regional agenda, including the security build-up in parts of the Caribbean and its potential impact on member states.It said that the position at that meeting was not endorsed by the government of Trinidad and Tobago.Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro has accused Washington of seeking a regime change in his country with its naval deployment in the Caribbean, saying “they are seeking a regime change through military threat”.He has also accused Persad-Bissessar of allowing Trinidad and Tobago to be used in carrying out the US plans."
